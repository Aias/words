*How are you doing today?*

Reading from Boston after waking up early to vote. Nervous. A photograph from last night's walk captures some of this anxiety.

*What beautiful, banal thing did you see today?*

![night, light](2020-11-04.jpeg)

At night, the simple Ikea lamp above my bed creates a little box of light that's perfect for reading myself to sleep.

*What did you see today that moved you?*

Curved windows opposite this alley wall in Back Bay focus glancing autumn sun into a keyhole of light.

*How are you doing today?*

Frustrated, impatient, annoyed, but mostly tired. Lots to be worried about, very little that actually matters.

The day looks bright, in sun and spirit. An afternoon for walking and catching up with old friends.

*How are you feeling right now?*

Energized and adventurous, but also just a little hungover.

*How are you doing today?*

![Decaying plaster wall](2020-11-09.jpeg)

A weekend of quiet celebration continues with an impromptu day away from work, to walk the city and discover new places.

*How are you feeling today?*

![Light reaches in](2020-11-10.jpeg)

Distracted. I find it increasingly difficult to do real work these days – it may be time to try something new.

*How are you feeling today?*

It's amazing the difference just one 10-hour-sleep night can make.

*What's happening? How tired are you?*

![Autumn swirl](2020-11-12.jpeg)

I've switched to tea for the past few days. A more subtle morning kick.

*What did you eat today?*

![Fundido](2020-11-13.jpeg)

Queso fundido – poblanos, onions, chorizo, cheese – is a comfort classic. Too few places make it well, I prefer to do it myself.

*How are you feeling today?*

Excited to see a couple friends and explore our old college campus.

*How are you feeling today?*

Ashamed after a day of overly-heavy drinking. Laying in bed, away from the world.

*How are __you__ doing today?*

![Bug lamp](2020-11-16.jpg)

It's another regular work day here in Boston, getting colder but still not yet winter. Just passing time.

*What do you do on a down day?*

![Genki-ya sushi restaurant](2020-11-17.jpg)

Whether in a down mood or down on responsibilities, either way my go-to is finding something new. Like this wall of Japanese letters that seems like paper at thumbnail size, but reveals its physical texture on closer inspection.

*How are you doing today?*

![Streetside tent](2020-11-18.jpg)

Crazy how easy it is to go from bored and unchallenged to completely overwhelmed by work. Suddenly there is so much to do and not enough time to do it.

*How are you doing today?*

![Pay attention](2020-11-19.jpg)

I haven't had to talk this much in months – I'm worried that I might forget how.

*Think of a recent frustrating day; what beautiful moment was lodged in between the garbage?*

![UV](2020-11-20.jpg)

November 6. An email exchange with an author who wanted me to take down his content from a small personal project of mine. Within his rights, but in my opinion counterproductive. I forgot about it after seeing this typographic play of reflected light on the side of my favorite Brutalist building.
