# The Michigan

A [Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_hot_dog) is a regional style of hot dog beloved by the residents of upstate New York. Michigans are similar to Coney Island or chili dogs, consisting of a hot dog and bun topped with ground-beef-based "Michigan sauce". Optional (but indispensable) toppings include chopped raw onions and yellow mustard.

The first Michigan stand was opened in 1927 by Eula and Garth Otis, in my hometown of Plattsburgh, NY. The years since have seen a number of spinoff restaurants. When ordering a Michigan, to specify you want onions, you say "with". If you want the onions *under* the sauce (recommended), you additionally specify "buried". For example, "I'll take 3 Michigans with and buried." You will be judged as a tourist if you actually say the word "onion" while ordering.

In addition to the numerous Michigan-selling establishments, every Plattsburgh family has their own closely-guarded sauce recipe. What follows is from the author's mother, Tammy Trombley:

## Ingredients

### Sauce
- 1 lb ground beef
- 1 cup water
- 8 oz can diced tomatoes, blended, or pre-blended tomato puree
- 1 tbs chili powder
- 1 tbs cumin
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 tbs Tabasco or similar hot sauce

### Everything Else
- 1 package hot dogs (Note: Regular hot dogs are fine, but for a true upstate NY experience, see if you can get your hands on a package of [Glazier-brand dogs](https://glazierhotdog.com/), commonly known as "red snapper" dogs, for their distinctive color and natural casing.)
- 1 package buns
- 1 white onion, finely diced (optional)
- Yellow mustard (optional)

## Preparation

1. Preheat a medium-sized saucepan to medium-hot, then add ground beef and separate while browning.
2. Once the beef is partially browned, reduce heat to medium and add a cup of water.
3. Continue mashing until beef is fully cooked and reaches a very fine consistency. It should be finer than taco filling, but don't go too far and turn it into a paste. Best to use a [meat masher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_erG7HSK0A&t=629s) for this, but a slotted spoon will do.
2. Drain excess liquid from the meat, then add remaining sauce ingredients and mix until well-combined.
3. Reduce heat and simmer for about an hour, stirring occasionally and salting to taste, until the sauce has reached a consistency which might appropriately be described as "meat sludge".
4. While simmering, bring a pot of water to a boil and add your desired number of hot dogs. While the hot dogs are cooking, place a mesh strainer over the pot and use the steam from the water to warm the buns. Steamed buns are a necessity.
5. When everything is ready, assemble the Michigan in one of the following orders: (with & buried (recommended)) bun -> hot dog -> onions -> sauce -> mustard; (with) bun -> hot dog -> sauce -> onions -> mustard.
6. Serve, ideally in a [hot dog boat](https://www.amazon.com/hot-dog-boat/s?k=hot+dog+boat) lined with checkered deli paper.
