Nice to see everyone today. I want to talk about a course I attended on October 4th, taught by Edward Tufte. The informal yet informative session was part of my continuous learning, and worth mentioning, fully covered by our company. I suggest you all use our yearly educational fund, getting reimbursed is simple. The six-hour course was about "Reports and Presentations: Content, Analytical Thinking, Clarity, Efficiency, and Truth." Today, we'll cover the course materials relevant to our work, focusing on effective communication—the core of Tufte's teachings.

As part of our ongoing design book club meetings, I'm hoping you'll jump in with questions or thoughts—your input will make our discussion more lively. While I'll guide us, your contribution is more than welcome. I have a rough plan, but we may need to adjust as we go.
Before we kick off, let's talk about Edward Tufte, the guy in the bottom left photo. That picture wasn't taken on the course day but it gives you a good idea of who Tufte is. He often refers to Feynman diagrams (as you can see in the top right). Tufte, standing next to a well-designed information graphic in the bottom right, is in his early 60s. He's a well-respected statistician and professor of Political Science, Statistics, and Computer Science at Yale among other places.

What's more, Tufte is well-known for his published works. So far, he's authored five books, all focusing on presenting information in a clear and effective manner. His work marries art, statistics, communication, and presentation—setting industry standards for crafting high-quality graphics and presentations. One standout is "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information," an important book that was my first introduction to his work. His latest release, "Seeing With Fresh Eyes," came out in the last couple of years.

The subtitle on the first slide, "The Galileo of Graphics," is a fitting description for Tufte. In data visualization and information design, he's a leading voice for effective thinking and best practices.

Before we dive into the course material, I want to show you a different side of Tufte—his sculpture garden, Hog Penn Hill Farms, a 250-acre art wonderland in Connecticut. It's filled with large artworks, highlighting Tufte's deep interest in sculpture. One notable piece, "Larkin's Twig," displays an interesting visual effect that we'll discuss later. It's quite impressive how Tufte keeps this outdoor art exhibit open for the public to enjoy.

Tufte's dedication and passion were the main reasons I attended his course when he came to Boston. It felt pretty special. Tufte is, in big part, why I became a designer. I learned the importance of effective communication from his books when I was starting out. His books, rife with useful tips, are beautiful examples of the principles they teach. Frankly, without them, I'm not sure I'd be where I am in my career today.

The screenshot on the left, titled "Slide Gallery," is from a class I taught called "Presenting Information Effectively," which leaned heavily on Tufte's principles.

Moving to Tufte's course, it covered elements from all his books and was relevant to a broad audience, including both presenters and information users. It leaned especially on his latest book, "Seeing with Fresh Eyes." In it, Tufte talks a lot about the fine art of presenting and teaching, focusing on how to share information in a clear, honest, and inclusive way.

The screenshot on the left, from the course handouts, shows an interesting part of Tufte's course—his unique teaching style and how he ties it to the course materials.

Upon reaching the venue, we were given a packet of materials, which included three of Tufte's books—"Presenting Information," "Beautiful Evidence," and "Seeing with Fresh Eyes"—and a course handout that acted as our guide for the day. Each page of the course book was crammed with material, giving us plenty to unpack.

While the course book was packed with insights, it didn't have the same polished look and feel as Tufte's books. The main page was a bit messy with its information overload, somewhat reminiscent of a conspiracy theory site, somewhat like the "Time Cube" meme. Still, the information in it was definitely useful.

Before we delve into Tufte's teaching style and its relevance to our handout, let me address Meg's question about the audience. The seminar was held in a hotel conference room, a venue Tufte likes because it pulls in a diverse crowd, not just academic-oriented individuals. Participants could've been there due to employer recommendation or personal interest in the topics.

From my observations, many attendants were there for professional development. The audience wasn't just designers, but also included professionals like nurses and businesspeople—indicating that the key audience included those keen to enhance their everyday communication of information. And while the course materials may have suggested otherwise, it's worth noting that Tufte actually does have a strong command of typography.

Responding to Meg's question about the presence of other UX designers or visualization users, I can't say with certainty. We didn't do introductions, and my sense of the audience is based on conversations I overheard.

Shifting to Tufte's teaching approach, the first thing he had us do was get comfortable with the provided notebook, emphasizing it wasn't a sacred document but something for personal use. He encouraged us to add our own notes extensively—it was a tool for navigating the course material.

The image on the right demonstrates Tufte's strong advocacy for annotation: a page from a famed violinist's score covered with notes. Engaging deeply with the material means your notebook could end up looking much the same. A key part of Tufte's teaching approach is to give something tangible that attendees can engage with at their own pace, write all over, and note their thoughts on—this purpose aligns perfectly with the notebook. Interestingly, Tufte isn't a fan of slides, using them sparingly during the class. When he did use slides, they focused exclusively on a single graphic, allowing for a thorough discussion. Once the conversation about the graphic was done, the screen would go dark, shifting our focus back to our notebooks.

Tufte is big on real-life examples and case studies. During the course, he introduced materials from historical texts, including works by Galileo and a book on Euclid's geometric proofs. The screenshot on the right, from one of Tufte's books, recreates these ancient works. His enthusiasm was palpable as he discussed the ingenious use of tiny flaps in the book to transcend the two-dimensional space and depict multidimensional geometric proofs.

When it came to instruction methods, Tufte heavily used course handouts, annotated resources, and walkthroughs, while keeping slide usage to a minimum. The photo I've shared captures the scene from my desk—giving you a glimpse of the room’s atmosphere with Tufte at the lectern and a blank projector screen.

The course content is laid out in broad sections—not exactly mirroring the notebook segments. We touched on four primary themes: Credibility and Truth; Measurement and Research; Signal and Noise; and Meetings, Presentations, and Demos. Keep in mind, these topics sometimes blend into one another.

This slide isn't intended for in-depth reading but aims to provide a broad view of the subtopics we discussed in the course. Echoing the richness and pace of Tufte's handouts, it offers a peek into the comprehensive understanding we garnered from the myriad of themes and subthemes, images, examples, notes, and discussions.

Tufte's key emphasis, both at the beginning and end of the course, is the importance of a clear problem statement. Whether you're holding a meeting or designing a graphic, the what, why, and how should be crystal clear to everyone involved—and especially to you. Asking questions like 'What is the purpose of this presentation?' or 'Why are we having this meeting?' are vital to communicate ideas effectively.

The first major subtopic we touched on is credibility and truth. Tufte's interest extends beyond just the visual elements of data display—to broader issues like honesty in discourse and the importance of being doubtful. In essence, how do we determine the reliability of the information given to us, and how do we evaluate the resources shown? This perspective encourages raising our viewpoint a notch, allowing us to judge the integrity of the presenter and gauge the trust we should place in them.

Here, I'd like to digress a bit to talk about 'stack lists', as shown by the 'UI Day' example in Tufte's latest book, 'Seeing with Fresh Eyes.' Stack lists are typographic techniques that almost turn words and line breaks into data—somewhat like poetry. I find this idea very intriguing, and it sparks thoughts about possible implementations, especially as typography is a large part of digital design. Can the words we choose and their layout convey extra meaning? Stack lists propose an interesting approach.

Getting back to credibility and truth, Tufte sheds light on this with great instances of data cherry-picking and lemon-dropping. Cherry-picking is the act of handpicking only data that backs up your argument, ignoring anything that disputes it. Lemon-dropping, on the other hand, involves showing only data that will lead your audience to draw the conclusion you desire. Both panels demonstrate how one might twist raw data to uphold certain stories. As presenters and viewers, we need to be alert to what summarized data might be glossing over. The most effective way to steer clear of these snags is to just present the data as it is.

Consider the graph at the upper right. If only the line linking the data points is observed, a trend appears to emerge. But on scrutinizing the individual data points, it becomes apparent there's no discernible trend. To prevent such deceiving interpretations, simply present the raw data. This allows your audience to spot patterns by themselves without being nudged towards a preconceived conclusion.

The example at the lower right demonstrates how summarizing a data set using box plots can hide significant details. Your original data could include unique and varied observations—like flying elephants—which these box plots neglect to show. This is a case of cherry-picking, lemon-dropping, and excessive summarization.

Next, while some researchers are skilled, others are not. A significant concern in certain areas of study is the replication crisis—common in social sciences—where many research papers cannot be reproduced by anyone other than the initial researchers. Holding the title of a researcher doesn't inherently bestow an understanding of how to present data truthfully or effectively, underlining why Tufte emphasized these points. He is deeply invested in these issues.

While Tufte's work offers valuable perspectives, there's a desire for him to explore in more depth the realms of digital design and UX. Currently, most of his focus lies in research domains outside the software industry.

A key principle in promoting credibility is not just to display your data, but also to reveal its roots, context, and sources. Suppose you're trying to demonstrate the impact of global warming. Simply showing a data line from 2023 wouldn't suffice. To provide richer context, you should compare it with data across the last 100 years. This approach makes it more evident how the present state deviates from past trends.

Tufte advocates the importance of respecting our audience's intelligence. He emphasizes that they can handle complex information, so there's no need to oversimplify or water down details. Instead of undermining the audience's intelligence, we ought to be open about the roots of our arguments. This transparency is fundamental to data presentation and comprehension. Striking a balance between simplicity and an appreciation for the audience's understanding is essential. Approaching everything with a grain of doubt, combined with asking questions like 'why?' and 'how do they know that?' preserves a healthy skepticism. This questioning mindset is a critical aspect of the succeeding section on measurement and research.

While I don't have many book screenshots to share on this topic, a key takeaway is the immense value of direct experience in research. Observing firsthand often surpasses the benefit of large volumes of data collected indirectly. Tufte highlights this, stating, "You never learn more about a process than when you directly observe how data are actually measured."

Reflecting on the value of firsthand experiences, I recall my stint at Epic, where we used to shadow professionals at various hospitals, spending time with nurses and doctors, and engaging them in conversation. Often, insights from one day's worth of such experience can outshine those gleaned from many research papers.

In essence, the insights and understanding derived from firsthand data collection are invaluable—these experiences connect you directly to the origins of your data, which is a critical step towards revealing truth. I strongly maintain that enhancing such interactive experiences can considerably enrich our collective knowledge and comprehension.

Transitioning to a more visual theme, the idea of signal and noise is intriguing. It prioritizes amplifying the signal—or critical information—in data visualizations and dimming the noise or unnecessary details. An optimal interface employs efficient graphics to simplify data presentation. Observe the examples to the left—these noisy and cluttered visuals fail to convey valuable information effectively. Compare these to the display on the right, which I think illustrates an emergency room interface. Spanning across three interconnected screens, this interface continuously presents thousands of real-time data points.

While the aesthetics of the interface could be a subject of debate, its competent handling of a massive data volume is admirable. It features real-time updates, introducing thousands of fresh data points with each refresh. Tufte lauds this as one of the finest interfaces ever created—a standard to emulate for real-time monitoring and visualization. This recognition emphasizes the need for clean, efficient interfaces for impactful data presentation.

We should aspire to a similar data presentation standard as the emergency-room display previously mentioned. It manages to effectively surface a wealth of real-time information for healthcare professionals, grounding our aspirations in delivering equivalent levels of detail and clarity.

Consider displays cluttered with superfluous details or oversimplified visuals. This 'noise'—such as excessive color intensity, thick dividing lines, and high-contrast text—often distracts from the central information. By minimizing the noise, you create room to boost clarity and incorporate more relevant details. For example, after removing non-essential elements, we could include further information like trends on total rainfall over a time frame, annotated with sequential snapshots showing a cloud's evolution.

Tufte underscores how effective small, sequential images can be in illustrating changes over time, as opposed to a continuous video. Studying these still images can often offer a more profound comprehension of the dynamics in play.

Another factor is 'Posh Lust', a term referring to the addition of non-essential details or graphics, which, while aesthetically pleasing, are not crucial to the presentation. This can arise due to external pressures or our own inclination to insert irrelevant elements.

Think about Paul McCartney's case. He strongly objected to extra instrumental enhancements that a studio unauthorizedly added to his song 'The Long and Winding Road.' He saw these extras as unnecessary add-ons that diverted from his original piece. This incident parallels scenarios in data visualization where undesirable elements are introduced, diluting the core message.

Reflect on the early days of PowerPoint to underline Tufte's resistance to it. When clip art and decorative defaults were the rage, they often contributed to 'Posh Lust'—unnecessary details that obstructed rather than enhanced communication. The principal lesson here is to avoid adding visuals purely for their aesthetic impact.

In the context of enhancing signal and reducing noise, direct labeling is a valuable tool. Particularly in research reports, it tends to be more effective to position labels directly next to the referenced items, rather than forcing the viewer to move their gaze between a legend and its correlating item. This principle isn't restricted to graphics—it applies to any situation involving matching items from two different locations. It's about improving communication efficiency and reducing cognitive load.

While direct labeling is a favored approach, it can also backfire with inadequate execution. For instance, this ear diagram on the left sourced from an old battlefield textbook uses harsh lines for labeling, seemingly piercing the graphic. Although its striking design—I even put up a print above my bed—highlights room for refinement in labeling techniques. Occasionally, guests question my choice of this image, attempting to comprehend its context. Nonetheless, it serves as a vivid reminder of how design choices can sway perception.

In relation to signal and noise, an essential design principle is the 'smallest effective difference'. The aim is to make visual distinctions as subtle as possible. Start with the smallest visual difference to clarify a specific detail and then scale up from there. This method helps to avoid overwhelming the design with harsh, competing contrasts.

The Ad Reinhardt painting on the right showcases the strength of subtlety. A slightly lighter shade of black forms a soft cross against an overwhelmingly monochrome backdrop, noticeable only when inspected up close. The painting's subtlety is more perceivable in-person than in photographs. Although Reinhardt's extreme subtlety may seem cryptic, the principle it exemplifies is valuable.

When creating maps or color scales, the 'smallest effective difference' principle can be particularly beneficial. Comparing two versions of color scales employed for depicting elevation, the less vibrant, less saturated scale often excels in emphasizing the data and giving visibility to other differences. Implementing this principle leads to more accurate, nuanced, and visually pleasing designs.

As a light-hearted aside, I remember an amusing incident concerning color scales a few years back. There was a surge in record-breaking heat, exhausting the existing color list—red indicated the highest temperature on the scale. The scale had to be expanded to include purples and browns. In the flurry to recalibrate with new colors, the importance of color selection in data encoding was poignantly highlighted.

Maps offer abundant lessons on data visualization. Tufte regularly cites Swiss mountain maps, regarded as some of the most data-packed yet beautifully crafted information displays. Often brimming with data in every corner, they set a high bar for accommodating vast amounts of information while maintaining readability—a primary objective for any visualization.

Subtle presentation techniques can greatly impact visual perception. Take this Larkin's Twig image, for example. On the left, the image is presented with nuanced color distinctions. By merely adding a soft outline on the right, the perceived depth and significance of the object shift dramatically. Even though both sides share the same fill color, the side with an outline seems darker. This effect, similar to the twig's surrounding area, illustrates an apparent volume from its outline function. It's an intriguing demonstration of how contours can mold perception.

Moving on to a critical theme: how to facilitate more effective meetings or create superior presentations? One impactful strategy involves distributing materials to attendees prior to the meeting. Acknowledging that this is often overlooked, another tactic—to ensure everyone is on the same wavelength—is to prepare the materials, hand them out at the meeting's onset, and allocate the first 10 minutes for silent reading. This technique, though unconventional, is surprisingly efficient in establishing a common context for the conversation. It's a typical practice at Amazon.

Turning to examples, Ken Kocienda's tenure at Apple highlights the value of demos. Demonstrations can effectively convey concepts, so they should be used wherever appropriate, especially in design or engineering fields. Demos can validate ideas by showcasing their real-world applications in ways that mere discussion cannot—for example, typing on an iPhone keyboard.

Concluding our discussion, let's tackle: Why not PowerPoint? There's a key difference between supplying a handout for people to follow and presenting a slideshow. PowerPoint often limits how you present content, generally promoting large chunks of text and complex hierarchies. I'm aware of the irony as I discuss this while showcasing slides, but this isn't PowerPoint. It's called IA Presenter, carefully crafted to overcome the usual shortcomings of its counterpart. While this tool favors content over layout, it doesn't resolve the problem of reading along.

Ideally, I could have compiled these slides into a PDF with notes and shared it with you before this presentation. In that scenario, we could have navigated through it together. Regrettably, I didn't take that step, though I should have. Notably, Amazon has entirely abandoned PowerPoint, discouraging verbatim on-screen reading without meaningful information engagement.

Tufte's critique of PowerPoint finds an elaborate explanation in his essay, "The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint". He points to a particular slide to symbolize its downfall: the presentation guiding the decision to greenlight the Columbia Space Shuttle re-entry. Tufte connects the subsequent Columbia disaster to this PowerPoint presentation, asserting that the slide downplayed certain critical findings. While the tool might not bear sole blame—the presenter's role is significant—Tufte's point highlights how the tool can influence the final output.

Ending on a positive note, let's examine what Tufte deems the best graphic ever designed: a visual depiction of Napoleon's march to Moscow. The brown line, which reflects the width of the army, traces the journey to Moscow, narrating the steady decrease in troop size. The black line portrays the retreat, continually dwindling until returning to the start. The stark comparison between the two lines dramatically reveals the terrible number of lives lost in the campaign. Tufte commends this piece for its striking efficiency.
