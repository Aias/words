It's great to see everyone here today. I'm eager to share insights from a recent course I attended: a casual but enlightening session. The course was taken on October 4th, taught by Edward Tufte, and was part of a continuing education endeavor. The experience was fully reimbursed—I recommend you all consider such a seminar style or professional development courses. We have a generous annual stipend for this purpose, and the reimbursement process was straightforward and fast.

The course, entitled "Reports and Presentations: Content, Analytical Thinking, Clarity, Efficiency, and Truth," spanned roughly six hours, including lunch break. Today, I am going to walk you through the course materials relating to our work. We’ll be exploring general principles of effective communication, which is the essence of Edward Tufte's teachings.

In line with our weekly design book club meetings, I encourage you to raise questions or comments, as your engagement will make the session more interactive. Although I will guide the conversation, your active participation is welcomed. As I have not meticulously planned these 60 minutes, I may need your cooperative intervention at times.

Before starting, let's briefly discuss Edward Tufte. The photo in the bottom left indeed depicts him, though not from the course day. It's an accurate picture of Tufte, who often references Feynman diagrams (shown in the top right) in his books. He's standing next to a graphical illustration in the bottom right—an example of excellent information design, as per his own words. Tufte, about 60 to 65 years old, has been a statistician and a Political Science, Statistics, and Computer Science professor, primarily at Yale, for quite some time.

Additionally, Tufte is unanimously recognized for his published books. To date, he's penned five—each having goals of explaining principles to present information meaningfully and effectively. His work, an intersection of art, statistics, communication, and presentation, lays down the standard for best practices in designing high-quality graphics and presentations. Particularly noteworthy among these books is his seminal work, "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information"— the first of its kind that I had the privilege to read. The most recent addition, "Seeing With Fresh Eyes," emerged in the past year or two.

The subtitle on the first slide, "The Galileo of Graphics," is a title attributed to Tufte, and rightfully so. In the realm of data visualization and information design, Tufte is recognized for his authority on effective thinking and best practices.

Before we proceed to the class itself, let's see another aspect of Tufte's passion—his impressive sculpture garden, Hog Penn Hill Farms, sprawled across 250 acres in Connecticut. This space is filled with large-scale artworks demonstrating Tufte's interest in art, especially sculpture. One remarkable sculpture, "Larkin's Twig," demonstrates an optical effect we'll revisit later in this presentation. It's fascinating how Tufte maintains this open sculpture garden that anyone can visit.

His expertise and passion were reason enough for me to attend his course when he visited Boston, making the experience particularly special. Tufte is fundamentally the reason I became a designer; his wisdom in effective communication through his books was instrumental when I was exploring this field. These self-exemplifying books, filled with practical advice, are beautiful in their own right, showcasing the principles they intend to communicate. Without them, I doubt I would be where I am today in my career.

The screenshot on the left, titled Slide Gallery, is from a class I previously taught titled "Presenting Information Effectively." This course heavily drew from Tufte's works.
Now, focusing on Tufte's course, it included elements from all his books and catered to different audiences—presenters as well as consumers of information. It particularly drew from his most recent book, "Seeing with Fresh Eyes." He extensively discusses the art of presentation and teaching, emphasizing how to present information honestly, effectively, and inclusively.
The screenshot on the left, from his class handouts, captures an intriguing aspect of the course—Tufte’s approach to teaching and the relationship of the class to the materials used.

Upon arrival, we received a few documents. The set included three of Tufte's books—"Presenting Information," "Beautiful Evidence," and "Seeing with Fresh Eyes"—and a class-specific handout that served as the course book for the day. Each page of the handout was densely packed with content, and we spent time discussing it at different points.

Although the course book was quite informative, it hadn't gone through the same rigorous typographical and editorial work as Tufte's books. The front page appeared cluttered with information, reminding me of a conspiracy theory website, somewhat like the "Time Cube" meme. Nonetheless, the content was valuable.

I'd like to discuss how Edward Tufte teaches, as it's highly relevant to the handout. But before that, I'll answer Meg's question regarding the audience. The session took place in a hotel conference room. Tufte explained his preference for this venue as it typically attracts a wider range of people, not limited to those with academic interests. Attendees could have been recommended by their employers or anyone interested in the discussed concepts.

Observing the audience, I noticed many attendees seemed to be there in a professional development capacity. These were not just designers—it was a diverse group of professionals, including nurses and business personnel. This seemed to indicate that the primary audience comprised individuals eager to learn about effective information communication in their daily jobs. Despite the initial impression given by the course materials, Tufte indeed possesses excellent typographic skills.

In response to Meg's query about whether there were other UX designers or individuals who use visualizations, I'm not exactly sure. We didn't introduce ourselves, so my understanding of the audience comes from overheard conversations.

Moving on to Tufte's teaching style, the first thing he instructed us to do was to take the provided notebook, ensure it was completely flat, and not treat it as a precious document—an indication that it was for personal use. You're expected to annotate this notebook heavily; it serves as a guided exploration through the course's ideas.

The photo on the right is an example showing Tufte's emphasis on annotation—a page of a score for a famous violinist covered in annotations. If you engage deeply with the material, your notebook should end up looking similar.

So, a vital part of Tufte's teaching style is giving something tangible to the audience that they can digest and process at their own pace, mark up, and jot down notes on—the notebook serving this purpose perfectly. Interestingly, Tufte expressed a general dislike for slides, rarely using them in the class. If slides were used, they focused exclusively on one particular graphic, allowing a deep dive into that topic. Once the discussion on the graphic ended, the screen would go blank, refocusing attention on the notebooks before us.

Tufte thrives on examples and case studies. Throughout the course, he shared materials from centuries-old books, including Galileo’s work and another book about Euclid's geometric proofs. The screenshot on the right is an image from one of his own books, recreating these ancient works. You could see Tufte's passion as he described the brilliance of using small flaps in the book to "escape the flatland" of the two-dimensional canvas and illustrate multidimensional geometric proofs.

In terms of teaching tools, he predominantly relied on course handouts, annotated materials, and guided explorations—eschewing the use of slides. The picture I've included here shows my view from the desk, hinting at the room’s ambiance with Tufte at the podium in the distance, and no projection up on the screen.

The content of the course is divided into broad categories rather than being an exact replica of the sections in the notebook. The topics we discussed are grouped into four main headings: Credibility and Truth; Measurement and Research; Signal and Noise; and Meetings, Presentations and Demos. Please note that these topics sometimes intermingle with one another.
I didn't create the following slide for detailed reading, but rather to provide an overview of the subheadings and topics we covered in the course. Reflecting the dense, fast-paced nature of Tufte's handouts, it offers a glimpse into the holistic understanding we gleaned from the multitude of running headings and subheadings, various photos, examples, notes, and discussions.

Overall, the main point Tufte begins and ends with is the importance of having a problem statement. Whether you are conducting a meeting or presenting a graphic, the what, why, and how of what you're doing should be abundantly clear to everyone involved—including yourself. Questions like 'what is the point of this presentation?' and 'why are we having this meeting?' are crucial to effectively communicating ideas.

The first main subtopic of the course is credibility and truth. Tufte is not only concerned with the visual aspects of data presentation but also with broader areas like truthfulness in discussions and the importance of skepticism. Essentially, how do we discern the accuracy of what we're being told, and how can we assess the materials being shown to us? This approach allows for a level of abstraction, enabling us to evaluate the honesty of the presenter and the extent to which we should trust them.

At this point, I'll diverge briefly to discuss the format of 'stack lists', as demonstrated by the 'UI Day' example from Tufte's most recent book, 'Seeing with Fresh Eyes.' Stack lists are typographic devices, almost using words and line breaks as data, relating this to poetry. I find this concept fascinating and wonder how we can implement it, especially since a significant part of digital design is typography. Can the words we use and their arrangement convey additional meaning? Stack lists offer an intriguing solution.

Returning to credibility and truth, Tufte gives excellent examples of cherry-picking and lemon-dropping data to support this point. Cherry-picking refers to selecting only data that confirms your perspective while excluding contradictory information. Conversely, lemon-dropping means only showing data that leads your audience to the conclusion you want them to reach. The panels on the left and right both show how one can manipulate raw data to support specific narratives. As presenters and audiences, we must be mindful of what summarized data leaves out. Ultimately, the best solution to avoid these pitfalls is to simply show the data.

Consider the graph at the top right. If you only observe the line connecting the data points, it seems like there's a trend. However, if you closely examine the data points themselves, it becomes clear that there is no clear trend. Misleading interpretations can be avoided if you present the data itself, allowing the audience to identify patterns without being prodded towards a specific conclusion.

The example at the bottom right illustrates how summarizing a data set with box plots can obscure crucial information. Your original data set could contain very distinct and diverse information, like flying elephants, which these box plots completely miss. So, this is an example of cherry-picking, lemon-dropping, and over-summarization.

Moving on, there are obviously good and bad researchers. A critical issue in some research areas is the replication crisis—often found in social sciences—where numerous research papers fail to be replicated by anyone other than the original authors. Being a researcher doesn't automatically grant you an understanding of truthful or effective data presentation, which is why Tufte stresses these issues—he cares deeply about it.

While Tufte's work provides useful insights, I wish he would delve more into digital design and UX. Most of his focus is on research outside of software.

One of the core principles of promoting your credibility is not just to show your data, but also to expose the roots, context, and sources of that data. For instance, if you were trying to demonstrate the effects of global warming, it wouldn't nearly be as effective to show just one line from 2023. To provide a clearer context, you would want to compare it with data spanning the last 100 years. This makes it easier to see how the current situation is anomalous when compared to previous patterns.

Tufte encourages us to respect and care for our audience. They are capable of understanding complex ideas, and we must not overly simplify or dumb down information. Instead, we should trust our audience's intelligence and share the basis for our arguments. This honesty is integral to presenting and comprehending data. Maintaining a balance between simplicity and respect for the audience's intelligence is paramount. It's crucial to approach everything you hear and see with skepticism. Always ask questions such as 'why?' and 'how could they know that?' This questioning spirit is a key part of the next section on measurement and research.

Despite not having many screenshots from the book to share on this subject, one key point to note is the significant value of firsthand experience in research. Direct observation often trumps large data quantities gathered secondhand or thirdhand. Tufte underscores this by stating, "You never learn more about a process than when you directly observe how data are actually measured."

To emphasize the value of firsthand observations and interactions, I reminisce about my time at Epic where we used to make shadowing trips to different hospitals and spend time with nurses and doctors, asking them questions. A single day of such experience often provides richer insights than reading numerous research documents.

Essentially, gaining insights and understanding from actual data generation is irreplaceable—these experiences acquaint you with the roots of data, a pivotal step towards uncovering the truth. I firmly believe that increasing such hands-on interactions can significantly enhance our collective knowledge and understanding.

Moving to a more visual topic, the concept of signal and noise is fascinating. It focuses on enhancing the signal—or the crucial information—in data displays while minimizing the noise or extraneous elements. An ideal interface makes use of highly effective graphics, streamlining data presentation. Consider the examples on the left, which show very noisy and cluttered graphics failing to communicate valuable information. Contrast these with the display on the right, which I believe represents an emergency room interphase. This interphase, spread across three interconnected screens, presents thousands of real-time data points in a continuous stream.

Although the style of the interface is debatable, the sheer volume of data it manages to display effectively is impressive. As it updates in real-time, each refresh brings thousands of new data points. Tufte praises it as one of the best interfaces ever, a benchmark for real-time monitoring and visualization. This sentiment underscores the importance of having clear, effective interfaces to present data effectively.
Our benchmark for data presentation should be akin to the emergency room display I discussed previously. It effectively brings a wealth of real-time information to the forefront for doctors and nurses to use, and we should strive for a similar degree of detail and clarity.

Take for example displays of data that are overly simplistic or cluttered with unnecessary details. This 'noise'—use of overly intense colors, thick dividing lines, and high-contrast text—often detracts from the core information. By reducing the noise, you garner space to enhance clarity and add more pertinent details. For instance, after stripping away irrelevant details, we could incorporate additional information like trends on total rainfall over a given period, annotated with sequentially captured images showing how a cloud evolves.
Tufte highlights the effectiveness of small, sequential images to convey changes over time, as opposed to a continuous video. By observing these stills, you can often gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics involved.

Another element to consider is 'Posh Lust', an issue relating to adding unnecessary details or graphics which aren't vital to the depiction but are merely inserted for aesthetic appeal. It can occur because of external influences or our own temptation leading us to incorporate irrelevant details.

Consider the case of Paul McCartney. He voiced an emphatic 'no' to the additional instrumental enhancements that a studio had incorporated into his song 'The Long and Winding Road' without his authorization. He viewed these as extraneous additions that detracted from his original composition. This incident mirrors situations in data visualization where unnecessary elements are added, detracting from the main message.

To underscore Tufte's aversion to PowerPoint, think of the platform's early days when clip art and decorative defaults were trending. These often introduced 'Posh Lust', unnecessary details that hampered instead of aiding the intended communication. The takeaway here is not to add graphics simply for the sake of appearance.

With regard to signal enhancement and noise reduction, direct labeling stands as an effective practice. Whenever feasible, particularly in research reports, it's generally more beneficial to place labels right next to the item being referred to instead of casting a viewer's eye back and forth between a legend and the thing it's referencing. This principle applies not only to graphics but also any situation where matching items between two places occurs. It's about enhancing communication efficiency and minimizing mental load.

Direct labeling, while it's a preferred method, can also misfire with poor implementation. This ear diagram on the left, borrowed from an antiquated battlefield textbook, uses intense lines for labeling that appear to stab into the graphic. Although visually arresting—a fact underlined by how I hung a print out above my bed—it shows there's room for improvement in labeling technique. People visiting sometimes question my choice of the image, trying to decipher its context. It is, however, a stark reminder of how design choices can impact perception.

Considering signal and noise, a crucial design principle to keep in mind is 'smallest effective difference'. The goal is to be as subtle as possible with visual distinctions. It involves starting with the tiniest visual difference to elucidate a particular detail and scaling from there. This approach prevents overloading the design with loud, competing distinctions.

The AD Reinhardt painting on the right highlights the power of subtlety. A shade of black lighter forms a faint cross against a largely monochromatic background, detectable only upon closer inspection. In-person, its subtlety is far more visible than in photographs. While Reinhardt's extreme subtlety may border on the arcane, the principle itself carries merit.

In mapping or creating color scales, invoking the 'smallest effective difference' can be especially useful. Comparing two examples of color scales used for elevation representation, the more muted, less saturated color scale often does a better job of highlighting the data and allowing other distinctions visibility. Applying this principle results in designs that are more precise, nuanced, and visually appealing.

But as a humorous side note, I recall an entertaining incident a few years ago related to color scales.A couple of years ago, due to an upsurge in record-breaking heat, the existing color list was exhausted—red was as hot as it got. So they had to expand to purples and browns. It was a scramble to recalibrate with new colors, but this moment perfectly illustrates the relevance of color choice in encoding data.

Maps provide a rich source of lessons about data visualization. Tufte frequently refers to Swiss mountain maps, some of the most data-dense yet beautifully constructed displays of information. Often crowded with data in every crevice, they represent the gold standard for fitting large amounts of information while retaining readability - the ultimate goal for any visualization.

Subtle presentation techniques can profoundly influence visual perception. Consider this Larkin's Twig image. On the left, you see it with subtle color distinctions. By just adding a faint outline on the right, the perceived depth and importance of the object radically shift. Despite both sides having the same fill color, the one with an outline appears darker. This effect, much like the twig's surrounding area, evolves an apparent volume from its function as an outline. It's a fascinating example of how contours can shape perception.

Let's move on to one of the main themes: how to hold more effective meetings or create better presentations? A significantly valuable strategy includes disseminating material to attendees before the meeting. Knowing that's often ignored, another approach—to ensure everyone's on the same page—is to prepare the materials and distribute them at the start of the meeting. Everyone spends the first 10 minutes reading in silence—a surprisingly effective way to ensure everyone has the same context for the discussion. It's not a conventional method, but this approach is standard at Amazon.

Coming to examples, Ken Kocienda's time at Apple emphasized the importance of demos. Demonstrations can effectively communicate ideas so, wherever possible, use them, especially in design or engineering fields. Demos can substantiate ideas, showcasing real-world applications that talking cannot replicate—for instance, typing on an iPhone keyboard.

Last but not least, we answer the question: Why not PowerPoint? There's a key distinction between providing a handout for people to follow along versus presenting a slideshow. PowerPoint, in many aspects, can constrain the way you present content, often encouraging large amounts of text and complex hierarchies. I'm aware of the irony of discussing this while presenting slides, but this isn't PowerPoint. It's called IA Presenter, carefully designed to bypass common issues of its counterpart. This tool prioritizes content over layout, but it doesn't solve the problem of reading along.

Ideally, I could have prepared a PDF of these slides, notes included, and distributed it to you all before this presentation. In that case, we could have collectively navigated through it. Sadly, I didn't do this, but I should have. Interestingly, Amazon has entirely banished PowerPoint. They strongly discourage reading texts verbatim on screen without engaging in meaningful interaction with the information.

Tufte's criticism of PowerPoint is well explained in his essay "The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint." He uses one particular slide as an emblem of its downfall: the presentation used for the decision to enable the Columbia Space Shuttle re-entry. Tufte attributes the subsequently tragic Columbia disaster to this PowerPoint presentation, saying the slide undermined the gravity of certain findings. The tool might not be solely responsible—the presenter does carry importance—but Tufte's point is that the tool does shape the final output.

To end on a high note, let's look at what Tufte considers the best graphic ever designed: a visual representation of Napoleon's march to Moscow. The brown line (whose width represents the army's size) traces the journey towards Moscow and demonstrates the shrinking size of the troops. The black line depicts the retreat back, continually dwindling until it reaches the starting point. The comparison between the two lines starkly exhibits the devastating number of lives lost in the campaign. Tufte praises this piece for its impactful efficiency.
