there is no word
for the feeling
([that vague sensation][1])
of coming home
late Monday evening
with the final words
of a long night
in your open palm
(and the final images
in your selfish mind)
and asking yourself
(is it you who you ask?)
if this is, after all,
(at the beginning)
worth the trouble
