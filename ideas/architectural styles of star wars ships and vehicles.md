# architectural styles of star wars ships and vehicles

sand people --> brutalist junkyard /  pawn shop.
star destroyers --> gothic? postmodern? (because of the blockiness)
death star --> buckminster fuller turns to the dark side
exegol --> ancient roman meets nazi germany in a wasteland

Really it’s just the Sand People that really gave me Brutalist vibes, probably because their ship is basically a moving building and it’s easier to make the connection, but some of the others kind of make sense too.
