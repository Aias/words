# a dream

In my dream there is a man.
He lives in a city, on a quiet street.
There is a corner grocery nearby,
and a bar two blocks over,
and a cafe with one of those expensive Italian espresso machines,
and maybe somewhere that bakes bread.
There are trees on both sides of the street.
If he lives in a house, it is a small house;
if he lives in an apartment, it is a spacious apartment.
It is built of brick, and has two floors.
Its floors are wood.
The first (floor) has a small, private entrance, off to one side,
framed by a wooden trellis which is slowly being claimed by vines.
And there is also a larger door, on a sliding track,
which can be opened up to the street on a nice day,
or when he is in a more public mood.
In the space onto which this door opens, the man works at a large wooden desk.
Maybe more accurately there are two desks, set in a right angle,
and forming a U-shaped enclosure when set against the wall on his left.
Another, fixed counter, an arm’s length deep, runs the length of the wall.
And an arm’s length above the counter there is a book shelf,
filled with memories and ideas.
There are a couple lamps overhead with incandescent bulbs, not too bright.
They often cast fuzzy shadows on the surface
of a body, hunched in thought, struggling to meet a deadline.
On the desk facing the opposite wall are:
two or three large glass screens, a keyboard, and a mouse.
And a coffee cup, still steaming,
which rests among a collection of permanently stained rings.
The desk facing the street has a more open view — on it lay:
a large ream of gridded paper, scattered pens, pencils, and markers.
Scattered around the space are a few large and leafy plants
that the man often worries about, and waters too often.
There is a small kitchen area towards the back of the room,
with a coffee maker, and a fridge,
where it's likely that one would find a few interesting beers.
The kitchen itself is on a slightly raised platform,
maybe just two or three steps up from ground level.
When there are guests, the edge of the platform makes a nice sitting place.

But this is a dream, and nothing more.
