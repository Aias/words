# liberating space

Followup to recent fragment

If software designers are the architects in this analogy, who are the sculptors?

My best guess is that graphic designers practice the reciprocal vocation. Graphic design is more about expression and communication than it is about the ritual of living. You may commission a sculptor for a piece that shows who you are, but you probably wouldn’t want a sculptor to design your house. It’s a different approach —  form vs. space, function vs. friction. Yet there is still a deeper relationship there, and it’s not surprising that graphic design degrees remain a popular background for UX jobs.

### features as form, friction as space

This all may sound obvious until you consider how universally our typical modern tech companies refuse to assign dev hours to any project unless it somehow ticks another box on their new features list. It is possible to do too much, and it’s often better to do less. If we’re at a company with 50% of our market (whatever that market happens to be) and looking to expand into a new area, maybe we should be asking ourselves instead why the product doesn’t capture 100% of our current niche.

Everyone knows that design is in the details, and yet we’re too often fine with putting out “good enough” — we’ll come back to it later, someday. Apps that I used to love start to feel more like jobs than tools. And eventually I

There are a few (atypical) companies who seem to be practicing architecture rather than sculpture, creating seamless, frictionless experiences by taking a stand against feature bloat. By liberating our interactions from the burden of friction, these companies are creating spaces in which we can think. Here are my current favorites:

- [Figma][figma]
- [Airtable][airtable]
- [Netlify][netlify]
- [iA][ia]

I can only hope that places like these continue to set a good example for our industry, and that more organizations follow their lead.
