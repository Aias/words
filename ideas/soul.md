# soul

What is a soul?
To the extent that a soul is, of course, a thing that can be named at all.
If it is a thing that can be defined. A concept that may be seen to have edges, if only fuzzy ones.
What does it mean to have a soul?
And we might at first try the answer: to have a soul is to be human.
But this is not only tautological, but demonstrably false. Why then do we say a dog has a soul? Or a horse? Or a bird?
And we would try the naive correction: a soul is the recognition of a conscious mind.
But then again you may say, why do we describe a house as having a soul? Or a piece of music? 
And we would reconsider.
But it could also be said that to recognize a conscious mind in a thing is not quite the same as recognizing the thing to have a conscious mind.
To say we recognize a mind in a thing is not always to ascribe the thing a mind itself.
As we often see the world for its reflection.
It is also to say that the thing reveals the mind of its creator. In a kind of secondhand way, we come to know the creator through the creation.
And in the making of a thing they leave behind a part of themselves, and it is this which we see.
If we cannot meet our subject directly, we may still know them by the tracks they leave. The trails in the snow. The footprints in the dust. The etchings of the cutting blade. The imprints of the hammer.
And so still we answer: to recognize a soul is to recognize a mind.
It need not be a person.
For we know the mind of mother nature in the spirit of her creations.
But now we may have reached a point where it seems like soul is in everything, and so is in nothing.
And we realize we are missing another piece of the puzzle.
Visible intent.
For our dwellings are the most human when we can feel a deep purpose in their creation, that every aspect of their structure is there for a reason.
And we sense the spirits of animals most strongly when we feel they have real intentions, as when a crow operates an intricate and puzzling piece of machinery to access its dinner.
Not only thoughts, but reasons.
