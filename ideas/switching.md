Why it's important to change tools every once in a while.
Switching from XD to Figma, from Figma to Sketch and back.
Two major ideas: cleanup and understanding.
Cleaning out your closet.
Identifying patterns that help you understand the essence of the tool, and more easily transfer skills in the future.
And everybody hates moving, but I find it necessary for the same reasons. Cleanup, for obvious reasons, as most people throw out a ton of stuff when they move and are forced to reckon with the necessity of most of their things. And understanding, as through that process of keeping and discarding you come to a better idea of who you are and what you care about.
And it makes moving the next time easier.

But on the other hand, there something to be said for staying.
For using a tool so long it becomes an extension of your self.
The hammer whose wooden handle has been worn perfectly to the shape of your hand.
The wooden cheese barrel that's been used so many times it confers it's own character on the product it makes. (Michael Pollan, Cooked, Earth)
This kind of deep character (the quality that cannot be named) can only develop with age and time.
And it's the same deep character we recognize in the true artisan, increasingly rare.
And these kinds of tools that get better with time can themselves only be made through the same tradition of craft which does not seek to change just for the sake of change.
So yes, switch, but also stay.
If you've found it, and you know you've found it, don't leave it.
There's a life lesson in there somewhere.
