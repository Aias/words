# switching gains

This article makes me think of an idea I had a few times now that it's actually worth switching tools every once in a while purely for the sake of switching and not because one tool is better than the other. By switching, you create enough friction that you start to pay more attention to what's working for you and what isn't. You hold on to what's important and let go of what isn't. Switching in either direction would have produced the same results for comparable tools.

Like how I switched from airtable to notion and back over the course of three years. Or from reminders to things to fantastical. Or from craft to ia writer to both to something I don't even know right now what my note taking process is.

None of these switches were successful because of the tool itself. At least not entirely. If they were successful, it was because of the switching. It allows one to take stock of their own process to come up with something better. It forces a certain amount of intentionality. Forces you to develop a more coherent concept for your own ways of thinking, working, and living.

So I say, switch. Often. Switch back if it doesn't work. Don't feel locked in to what you're currently doing. Introduce friction and randomness in controlled ways.
