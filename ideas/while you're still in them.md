# while you're still in them

I like to make playlists made up of songs that capture the essence of a particular time in my life.
Having the songs isn't quite enough, you also have to know which part of your life they're associated with.
This is hard to do without the lens of time. You can't reflect on your life until after you've lived it.
Makes me think of Andy's line from the last episode of the office.

> I wish there was a way to know you were living the good times while you're still in them.
