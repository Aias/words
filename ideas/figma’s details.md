# figma’s details

Small details which elevate Figma from just another tool for making screens to an artful extension of our minds, eyes, and hands.

- When you copy a frame that ends in a number, like “Workflow Step 1”, Figma will automatically increment that number on the copied frame, calling it “Workflow Step 2”. Contrast this with how XD or Sketch handle copying and renaming, which I believe would name the copy “Workflow Step 1 - 1”
- If you have the help menu open showing keyboard shortcuts, and you use one of those shortcuts, Figma keeps track of the ones you’ve used so far by highlighting them in blue, as a way of almost gamifying the learning process.
