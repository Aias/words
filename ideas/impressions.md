# impressions

I have a confession:
I can’t finish my ideas.
It’s not that I don’t want to. The whole reason I started this blog was so I’d have a place to write things.
Writing feels good. I enjoy doing it.
But I can’t seem to put together more than a paragraph or two at a time.
People like Robin Rendle or Frank Chimero or Geoff Manaugh or Joel Spolsky or Paul Graham or Matthew Strom baffle me.
I think I want to believe that there’s some merit in disconnected thoughts. In a series of impressions more than logical coherence.
This idea isn’t without some precedent.

Time out of mind.

### smiljan radic

> Radić’s texts are almost always assemblages of several pieces or paragraphs that, although written by an architect, do not attempt to refer to a particular project or work (and if they do, it is always laterally, avoiding explanations of the how and the why, or demonstrations and apologies).
> 
> Like notes from a fragmentary diary or a review of a collection of memories, at times they share the melancholy tone of the writings by Aldo Rossi and at other times they recall the obscure density of John Hejduk’s poems.

The design of this site was inspired heavily by *Every So Often A Talking Dog Appears*, including the decision to call my blog posts “fragments”.
The meaning of Radić's essays does not appear as a light switched on in a dark room, but more as a slow fog rolling over the hills, or the sun coming up on the horizon. It is an abstract, dispersed meaning, seemingly more to experience and feel than to understand.

### christopher alexander

*The Timeless Way of Building*, prose poetry.

### parts and wholes

Or a painting by Kandinsky.
Maybe disconnected isn’t the right word.
Maybe a better way to put it is the parts bear no obligation to each other in any combination besides the unit and the whole.
There is the impression of a sentence, and there is the feeling of the whole essay.
Whether one part comes before or after another makes little difference.
