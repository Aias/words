# two frameworks for thinking about craft

My dad is the quintessential craftsman. For over thirty years now he's run a small sailmaking business in upstate New York, first with his brother out of a converted old stone church, and now solo out of a converted old dairy barn. His day to day work sees him traveling to local marinas, putting up and taking down sails, fixing what can be fixed, recommending replacements for what can't, and tinkering on any of the thousands of boat parts, large and small, that most people don't know exist.

If you have family like this, you probably already understand that it's not something people turn off when they're done their daily work. It's more of a philosophy or an ethos, an approach to life. When he's not strung 30 feet up a mast, my dad is busy building a new house. When work is slow, he takes odd jobs as a well driller or an electrician. There's never a time when he's not doing something that is an extension of the craftsman's fundamental drive.

It wasn't until relatively recently in my life that I became aware of how deeply this attitude has affected my own view of work, and though software design at first seems a world away from sailmaking, I think that the idea of craft and the way of organizing work that it implies has led me, consciously or not, to where I am today.

I don't believe that craft means manual labor. It doesn't necessarily denote a particular quality or standard. And it doesn't require adherence to tradition or ancient wisdom.

So what then?

Pye actually prefers not to use the term craft at all

Holistic vs prescriptive technology 

In my professional life I've spent probably multiple orders of magnitude more time working prescriptively than holistically. It's what I've done for somewhere between 8 and 9 hours a day, every work day, for the past 5 years. But my own strange little personal projects (like this blog), the kind that I own and create end to end, still mean much more to me than anything I've created within a prescriptive system of labor. They have my soul in them, like digital horcruxes. My heart lies with holistic work, with craft, and I don't think I will ever feel like I've found my *vocation* until that's how I'm working on a daily basis. Hopefully there's still time.

There's very little value judgment involved in this. Yes, I believe that the world would be improved if *more* people oriented their lives towards holistic technology, but I definitely don't believe that *everyone* should, universally. Probably not even a majority. We need both ways of working. It's just that right now the balance seems tipped too far in the prescriptive direction.
