# the taxonomy of work 

You could create a taxonomy of jobs and roles in much the same way that taxonomists create information architectures for species.

It sounds a little weird to talk of a person's role as if it were their species, but the relationship of individuals to their shared abstract qualities works basically the same in user research as it does in ecology.

In many ways the analogy is more useful than thinking in terms of personas, since taxonomies are more flexible in how they map to the real world. We may recognize that two species we thought were the same are in fact different, or we may add additional hierarchy to group species at higher and higher levels. We can use things we know about the class to predict things we haven't yet confirmed about the genus, and again for the species and the individual.
