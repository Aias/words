# details

When I say that all good design is done at the level of details, what do I mean by that?
What exactly is a detail?
A first attempt might be to say that a detail is anything that could have been done differently. Or maybe more precisely: could have been done *less*.
Consider the Barcelona pavilion.
The fact that the all the walls and floors and ceilings are arranged according to the same modular grid system is not a *detail* of the construction. It is a constraint. Self-imposed, to be sure, but a constraint nonetheless.
On the other hand, the butterfly marble wall, split in two and then laid open like a book, decidedly off the grid system (two high instead of three high) is a detail.
If we're connecting this essay to the essay on Soul, then we'd probably say that details are where the soul of the maker reveals itself. Because, free from any external or internal constraints, they become the purest distillation of the mind's internal decision process. They reveal personality. Taste.
There needs to be some amount of arbitrariness if a design is going to feel like it has a soul. Which is why it's almost impossible to make anything good completely democratically. The horse designed by committee. On a committee, all the details get argued away as unnecessary or out of place.
The specific size of the grid, too, could be seen as a detail. Why 1.1m^2? Why not exactly 1?
Well, because it would have been too easy. It wouldn't have been "just so".
A detail is the laborious, painstaking selection of exactly *this* shade of red in a painting, or agonizing over the precise final word of an essay, as the audience watches your progress and asks themselves: what's the point?
Until the work is complete and they see, even if they still don't understand.
