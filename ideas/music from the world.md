# music from the world

I was going to buy a set of Airpods Pro today, only to find that they were sold out and probably won’t be available anywhere for at least another month.

But in doing my pre-purchase research, I learned about their “Transparency Mode”, which sounds like it’s not only turning off the noise cancellation, but actively helping sound from the outside world “pass through” the headphones into your ears. As opposed to standard in-ear (non-noise-cancelling) headphones, which tend to make the outside world seem muffled, muted, or far away.

I also recently watched Inception again, since Netflix acquired it. And I was reminded of how big a role sound plays in that movie. If you’ve seen it, you probably remember that they used music at each dream level to synchronize their “kicks”, and let their dreaming selves know that it’s soon time to wake up. A specific track, actually – *Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien* by Edith Piaf. A designated non-dreamer at each dream level would kick off this process (pun intended) by placing headphones on the dreamers and playing the song as they slept. (For some reason I had in my head that Hans Zimmer’s classic *Time*, on the soundtrack, was in some way a super-slowed-down version of Piaf’s song, but can’t find any evidence for this, so I must have made it up. Or dreamt it.)

Anyway, the experience of this from the dreamers’ perspective, as their sleeping selves one level up processed it subconsciously, was to hear the music almost as if it were coming from the world itself. Not from any specific place, but from everywhere.

I imagine that Transparency Mode is kind of like that. You are present in the world. You hear the world, but now the world has a soundtrack.
