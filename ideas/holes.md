# holes

Metaphorical analysis of different kinds of holes.
A rabbit hole vs. a wormhole vs. a black hole
Rabbit holes take you down a path, there may be no exit, and you have to actually traverse the full distance on your way
A wormhole transports you from one place to another, there is an entrance and an exit, and you don’t experience the journey along the way
A black hole sucks you in, there is no journey, only an entrance and no exit.

This would be funny to compare to the veep episode with the presidential candidate debate where one of the candidates keeps saying the word hole over and over.

It could also be interesting to compare to Laurel Schwulst’s essay on eggs, since it’s a similar exploration of a thing and the way people use it metaphorically.
