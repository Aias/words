# dynamic resume

A webpage which uses AI to generate a resume for a company on-the-fly, which takes real experience into account, but customizes based on the role, the viewer, and the organization.

The page should be printable as a PDF, uses GPT to generate structured data which is then displayed dynamically.

> a big problem is that a static resume needs to be sufficiently legible to very different personas eg ats/recruiter/hiring manager/possibly leadership. feels like theres a gap in the market for some kind of dynamic doc
