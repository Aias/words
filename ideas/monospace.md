# monospace 

monospace fonts and dark backgrounds
why use them for long-form reading and writing?
because people write long-form writing in monospace fonts now
i should know, i’m doing in now in iA writer
and if you create an object in a certain context,
wouldn’t you want it received in that context?
i know i would

it’s like taking a square block of graffiti’d cement,
framing it,
and putting it in an art gallery.
it’s not meant for that context.
it was meant for the highway underpass
and the skate part
and the abandoned building,
and the mindset of someone looking at graffiti in its original context
is much different from even that same person looking at graffiti in the Tate or the Met

my writing isn’t suitable for the font on this website any more, I think
it probably never was, I just didn’t see it
