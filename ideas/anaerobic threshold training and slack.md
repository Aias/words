# anaerobic threshold training and slack

Unclear on what this means, but just a rough idea for now.
There’s a comparison to be made between the concept of “slack” in terms of work or a company – https://fs.blog/2021/05/slack/ – and anaerobic threshold (or heart rate) training for physical fitness.

Both approaches intentionally leave a certain amount of capacity available for either the individual (heart/lungs) or the larger system (body) that they are a part of.

Counterintuitively, it turns out that during anaerobic threshold training, you can make more progress towards fitness goals faster than you could if you were just working out at 100% effort all the time. It feels like you’re not doing as much as you could, like you’re “taking it easy”, and yet your body is actually making steady, efficient, continuous progress towards your goal.

If you compare two athletes, one of which trains as hard as possible every day to the point of exhaustion, and the other which keeps their heart rate in zones 3 or 4 most of the time, occasionally mixed in with harder work, then at the end of the season, the second athlete will almost certainly have made more progress relative to their starting fitness.

In the same way, if you have two organizations or two employees, one of which works to the bone every day and tries to squeeze out every last ounce of productivity, and one of which deliberately allows for a certain amount of free time (slack) in each day/week/development cycle, the second org/employee will also almost certainly have made more progress at the end of each cycle.
