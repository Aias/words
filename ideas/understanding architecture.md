# understanding architecture 

One of the best books I've read this year, but often just skimmable. I think the reasons I skip over so much of it are mostly due to the linear walkthrough format. Continuity of time and space is certainly a major way we experience architecture, but my favorite parts are reading about the relationships between things, not just a series of images.

I like reading that maybe the brick used in this construction came from a site across the sea and recalled the efforts of an older and very different culture.

The best parts are the details, the things you might not notice if your goal is just to tour these places. If you're looking to look but not looking to see.
