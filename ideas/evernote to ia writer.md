# evernote to ia writer

Currently prototyping a new process for a few different threads of my digital life.

There’s my commonplace book, barnsworthburning.net which could be done in iA writer, but is currently managed in Airtable with input from Evernote.
There’s The Innocent I, which pretty easily translates over, but is currently managed with Eleventy and new markdown files for every blog post, tracked in Github.
There’s my daily journal, done in Evernote.

I’ve been using Evernote for maybe 2 or 3 years now. It’s a tool I mention whenever anyone asks me what my favorite tools are. I still love it. I especially love the web clipper, an extension which almost single-handedly kept me using Evernote as long as I have.

Things I like about iA writer over Evernote:
- Less functionality, more focused on the only thing I need it for.
- Works with your existing file structure, specifically I like being able to have more than one level of nesting.
- Outputs actual files (text or markdown) instead of storing things in a proprietary database that requires more technical investment than I’m willing to put in if you want to get anything out of it. Don’t even get me started on how intimidating trying to work with Evernote’s API is.

Airtable also has its pros and cons. Even more than Evernote, Airtable is *the* digital tool I cannot stop gushing about to anyone who will listen. It powers so much of my structured ideas, including a digital adaptation of Christopher Alexander’s pattern language, my commonplace book, my portfolio site, and my user research database. Airtable oozes craft and breathes UX. And yet. It’s not perfect. As a cloud-based tool, obviously it has some of the same drawbacks as Evernote: a proprietary storage system (though it’s much easier to export, and has a super-easy-to-use API), no offline support, and trying to use it as a CMS comes with some of its own drawbacks. The API isn’t super speedy, and is rate-limited.

iA is a tool that has been mentioned enough times that I decided I had to try it, and I’m starting to think it can solve almost all of my problems with all of these tools, just by embracing local storage, simple files, and iCloud syncing. It’s really easy to plug into other systems, such as a git repository. It’s also a beautiful tool. Craft, design, care. Zen.
