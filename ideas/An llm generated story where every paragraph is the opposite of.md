An llm generated story where every paragraph is the opposite of the previous paragraph. Like a long game of telephone, but with a narrative arc.

Could start with the first paragraph being one from a famous novel or something equally interesting.

Do a hundred iterations of "give me the opposite"

Then feed in the whole thing into the model with the general narrative and ask it to modify the paragraphs to fit the arc.
