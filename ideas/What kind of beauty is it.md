What kind of beauty is it 
That would wonder at
A flock of restless starlings 
Formless form dipping into pools of flood light 
Still burning 
Over an empty high school football field
Hours since the victorious and defeated 
Have parted 

Now, only the beating of wings 
As night passes

(This poem is missing a sense of that half illuminated gradient, of the birds under the light slowly becoming less and less visible further out, until they blend in and disappear against the dark night sky.)

(It also may be out of order, and the image of the empty field should come first.)
