An interior design case study in the spirit of *Notes on the Synthesis of Form*, showing the decisions and constraints that led to the final layout of my apartment in Back Bay, Boston.

Note how constraints tend not to be completely changed, but further articulated as the process unfolds.

The process is one of identifying the primary driving 

### elements

1. One standard queen size bed
2. A modular glass desk, formed of two halves which can be arranged in a straight line, an L shape, or completely separated
3. One half of an L-shaped modular couch
3. Two bookshelf speakers and amplifier
4. A medium-large collection of books
5. A Concept II rowing machine


### constraints

Fixed into the apartment are a number of immovable constraints: The bookshelves surrounding basically the entire area; one bay window with semicircular built-in bench; a second window alcove with seat; an ornamental fireplace; a large enclosed area with shelves above, across from the fireplace; and a third window, partially enclosed, with no bench. Assuming we cannot change any of the fixed constraints, we have the following flexible constraints which help determine the interior layout of the space. These constraints may be weak or strong.

__Iteration One__
1. Bed within “alcove”
2. Desk toward outer wall


__Iteration Two__
1. Bed within alcove, perpendicular to wall
2. Desk toward outer wall, enclosing right window nook
