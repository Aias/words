# if i saw her again

I might say that I'm not as happy as I should be with the way my life has gone since we last spoke.
That I'm not proud (if proud could ever be the right word) of the decisions that I've made, or the ways I've chosen to live.
And there are lots of things that have turned out okay, but most of them just make me wonder why.
It's like a test I never studied for, and by blind luck have gotten some of the answers right, but the logic is all wrong. The understanding isn't there.
And as the decade passes all I seem to be able to do is look back.
You made the right choice, I might say.
Not to be here any more.
But I might say that I'm not as happy 
as I could be.
