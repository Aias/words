# agile development 

	In a kind of ironic way, a process which promised to bring order and coherence to software development ends up feeling almost schizophrenic, as system changes and new features arrive in bits and pieces with no clear connection to a bigger picture or the changes that came before. And behind the veil of predictable, periodic time, we are left not with order but with chaos – stories are finished and acceptance criteria are written tickets are completed, but nobody really knows where these things come from or what it's all adding up to.
	
	When we say we *must* release a new version every `X` days come hell or high water, it means that our products get split apart not at their natural seams but on the divisions of a calendar. We should understand the effect this has on the people trying to make sense of it all, those who we're  ostensibly creating the product for in the first place. 
	
	We should take it as a sign that no other creative field thinks it's a good idea to operate this way. When I order a salad in a restaurant, does it come out piece by piece? – first the lettuce, then the croutons, then the dressing, then the fork to eat it? Of course not, it arrives as a unit, all at once, even if that means it can't come out faster than its slowest ingredient. And why would I want it to? I don't care if I can get the lettuce in 30 seconds if I still have to wait five minutes before it's assembled and edible. And in experiential terms, staring at the half-finished mess on my plate certainly isn't going to make me appreciate the completed product more – if anything, it feels sloppy, and reflects poorly on the people trying to serve it to me.
	
	As an industry, we need to start pushing back against organizational structures and development processes that don't reflect the way real creative work gets done. Or our products are just going to keep getting [slower][1] and [shittier][2].
