# raw vs. rough

There’s a difference between software, or a product, or features, which are *rough* vs those which are simply *raw*. People tend to confuse the two.

A raw feature is like a raw steak - it may not yet be ready to eat, but you can tell right away whether it’s a good or a shoddy cut of meat. You would still spend money on it because of its potential for deliciousness, even though you wouldn’t eat it as-is.

On the other hand, a rough feature can be like a steak that’s cooked, but overdone to the point of inedibility, or full of gristle, or cut terribly, etc.

These can also be considered two completely separable dimensions. Something which is raw may not be rough, and vice-versa, but something may be both raw and rough.

A prototype built with basic HTML and CSS, but built within the grain of the web, in a way that can be enhanced with just a little extra effort, is like the raw steak. A released feature that’s sloppily-built, full of bugs, and ugly, is like the rough steak.

If you start with something rough, it’s almost impossible to improve its quality. If you start with something raw but high-quality, it’s easier to maintain that quality if you treat the thing with care and craft.
