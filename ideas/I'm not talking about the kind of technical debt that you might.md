I'm not talking about the kind of technical debt that you might be talking about 
You're right that not all is created equal 
And some is unavoidable. In four years there's going to be a new hot web dev framework that we want to work with and suddenly vue is going to go the way of marionette and suddenly we'll be complaining that there's too much legacy vue code around 
But I'm not necessarily talking about that kind of debt at all 
I'm talking about the user experience debt that accumulates during each sprint when all the minor details and refinements we can't plan for in design come out of the woodwork 
And at least three or four times every sprint I hear the familiar phrase "that's out of scope"
And then we never come back to it 
Those things that are out of scope represent small but real deficiencies in our product and they accumulate the way any other debt does 
And it's not good debt like a mortgage or something, it's more like credit card debt or payday loan debt. It will haunt you forever 
And this pattern is, I think, endemic to agile development more than some other forms of software management, not because it's incremental but because it's inflexible in its timelines.
It ignores a fundamental fact of design that most of the real design work happens not before development starts but while it's happening. You have to account for this. But so many organizations and processes are structured in a way that pretends design doesn't work like this and that if only we get the right designers and do enough planning or whatever then we'll be able to avoid the dreaded "that's out of scope" because we'll have seen all these eventualities ahead of time. It doesn't work like that. Design happens in the making, not before.
