# the benefit of the doubt

In one of Roman Mars’s *99% Invisible* episodes, he talks about how much you can learn from what seems an inconsistency in a movie, if only you give them the benefit of the doubt.
And by “them” I mean the writers, directors, actors, producers, etc. who all probably think about this stuff a lot more than you and are paid a lot more to do it.
In the episode Roman talks about *Star Trek* and *2001: A Space Odyssey* and some of the technology that feels user-hostile or unadvanced could actually be seen as way ahead of where we are.
Like in star wars why there are noises from the ships in space.
#etc 
And I think I’m ready to give Star Wars IX: The Rise of Skywalker the benefit of the doubt.
Let’s talk about some scenes where you could do this in:

<!-- these should be technological things if they’re going to fit the theme of my blog at all. things about design and UI, not over-talked-about plot stuff -->

the following is not a complete list
- the space tracker glowy pyramid things and how they work
- the fact that x-wings apparently can be preserved indefinitely underwater
- the whole concept of the communication tower weak point 
- C-3P0 not being able to translate the sith speak because he’s mechanically incapable of doing so

And it’s this last one that I really wanted to talk about, because I feel like a lot of people were slamming the whole concept with a lot of really obvious loopholes that it seems the writers should have probably considered before adding it to the movie.
Like #etc 
But consider the fact that in the star wars movies, we know that droids have achieved pretty sophisticated levels of sentience.
We can probably assume that, even though he looks like he was made in the garage of a rural truck mechanic, whatever is going on in C-3P0’s head is probably more complicated than the wires and transistors it *seems* like he’s made up of.
And the programming which affects his free will is probably more complicated than “do not run Sith language through audio output device”
It’s probably more like “do not communicate Sith language to another being”
Which in that case precludes him speaking it, yes, but it also rules out things like:
- writing it down on paper for Poe, Rey, and Fin to read, or 
- uploading it to another droid who didn’t have the same language restrictions
These are more sentient requirements. (Or maybe sensical is a better word, since they are how a person with common sense would interpret a command not to translate something.)

But even with all this I think I will eventually come to terms with everything in the star wars universe except for force lightning.
And I still think it would have been better if Rey wasn’t a Palpatine, and at the end when she was asked, “Rey who?” should have answered, “Just Rey.”
Nobody really needed the Skywalker name to continue.
As just “Rey” she would have entered into the ranks of Jedi important enough to go by a mononym:
Like Yoda.
