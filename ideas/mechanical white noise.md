# muffled mumbles

(residential white noise)
(unnatural white noise)
(urban white noise)

In particular thinking about
the groans
and creaks
and vents
and whooshes
and squeaks
and taps
and clicks
and clangs
and bangs
and drips
and buzzes
and hums
and thumps
and whirs
and scratches
and muffled mumbles
of an old house.
Or of an old apartment in Boston, for example.
I spent so long trying to silence them all, wishing I could sleep in peace.
But now I see they can be soothing. It's a matter of mindset.
Like sleeping with a snorer for so long that now you can't get to bed without them.
These old house sounds aren't much different from sleeping in a tent outside and listening to the sounds of the forest.
It has the same quality where it's sounds are patterned and predictable but never twice the same.
As a natural environment has a sonic character, so a residential environment has its own (character).
Here is an urban forest.
The sounds of an old house in Boston would be as different from  a high rise apartment in New York City as the sounds of a forest are from a desert.
There is an endless variety of urban white noise to be appreciated.
I wonder if there's anyone out there recording it.

<!-- Here you could actually do a kind of written translation of the nightly noises of this apartment into a written form. What would that look like? Maybe similar to that book you found of ocean sounds poetry in Daikanyama T-Site. -->
