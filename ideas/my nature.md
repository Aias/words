# my nature

I had an important realization recently about my nature as a designer. You could call it my constitution:

I'm a details person. I'm not suited to product strategy or big picture business decisions. I'm not the kind of designer you hire to churn out vaporware ideas to save a failing company. Sorry. My vision is too narrow for all that.

Instead, I'm the kind of designer that will put in the time and care and attention that will take your product from good to great. From an app that feels full of friction to a tool that feels like an extension of your body and mind.

I recently learned that the design team at Figma create trading cards for themselves, kind of "get to know me" designer stats, and one of the elements of those cards is a prompt: place a dot on the double diamond model where you feel most at home. My own issues with the double diamond model notwithstanding, I think this is a super interesting exercise and I encourage everyone to give it some thought.

I placed my dot here:
