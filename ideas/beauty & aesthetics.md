# beauty & aesthetics

Beauty is the subject of aesthetics,
but it does not play by aestheticsâ€™ rules.
Aesthetics is the judgment of beauty.
It is beauty with morals and values and right and wrong.

In aesthetics we see objects as being better and worse,
uglier and prettier.
But a beautiful object itself exists outside judgment.
It has neither time nor fashion.
And for having neither, cannot be better or worse
than any other thing.
