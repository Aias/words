# mise en place

There is an aspect of mise en place which is of obvious benefit: it involves searchability, being able to find what you're looking for quickly.

There is another less obvious aspect that is equally important: being able to put things back when you're done with them. It's not just about recognizing things as they fit in with the system, you also need to be able to see the holes they leave when they're removed. If there's something missing it should jump out to you.

A system of mise en place which enables only one of these two goals is not a fully formed system.

Why is mise en place important? Because often (if not usually) the organization of the toolbox is more important than the specific tools themselves. It's the difference between a creator's feeling of being "in the tool" (often called a state of flow) and a feeling of frustrating friction.
