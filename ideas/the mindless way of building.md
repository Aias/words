# The Mindless Way of Building: Design Systems as Bulldozers

Everyone and their mother has a design system these days. Every company, every designer, every brand. And they’re all the same. And it gives the impression that “doing design” can be reduced to choosing somewhere between 2 and 5 primary colors, a range of tints and shades, a typographic hierarchy with up to two fonts, a scale of spacing, and some stylistic details like whether or not our buttons have rounded corners.

One of Christopher Alexander’s strongest criticisms of contemporary architecture is the method of “bulldozing the site and starting from scratch,” so often seen in boring high-rise construction or corporate buildings. We ignore the larger context occupied by our architectural plans, and pretend like we can just design in a vacuum. Every decision can be made in advance, strictly planned and controlled, when we don’t have to worry about external factors affecting the design.

I’m starting to see our design systems as bulldozers. We level the surrounding area and create a pristine environment in which to do all future design work. It makes for the overwhelming sameness

[This][3] is a dangerous way of thinking:

> While designing a style palette, I don’t need to see artboards or vector tools. I want to see tools for choosing harmonious colors. I want presets for things like an 8dp spacing scale or a selection of type scales.

If you can’t see the system in context, it’s not going to work.
