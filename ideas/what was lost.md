# what was lost

Edmund Bacon, in *Design of Cities*, discusses the development of the projective plane and its effect on urban planning and architecture.
How something important was lost when we reduced what is inherently a 3-dimensional, temporal problem to a 2-dimensional view at a fixed point in time.
How this explains much of the character of our cities today, and many of the differences between them and our ancient models.
There are parallels here to the evolution of digital product design.
Compare website design prior to our modern design tools (in the era of Geocities) to what we get now, when we tend to design sites from a single perspective at a single point in time.
Why do so many of us look back so fondly on this era? Is it just nostalgia?
Maybe, but there was also a fundamental difference then in how we designed and constructed these pages.
They were all done in the medium itself.
Today we don’t design in the medium of the final product. We have (usually) vector-based tools which essentially just create static pictures, maybe with a bit of resizing control built in.
But resizing is not the main interaction users have with the site.
Much more often, it’s clicking, pointing, highlighting, focusing, selecting, moving, tabbing, cutting, pasting, copying, deleting, doing and undoing.
There are design tools that are trying to bridge this gap, and approach the problem interation-first, but the main ones: Sketch, XD, Figma, etc. – these all assume a static, non-interactive view of any site. They are the perspective projection of our digital process.

This kind of relates to an older idea I had, of “cubist mockups”, where many of the mockups I do don’t necessarily represent an actually possible state of the system, but rather a simultaneous view of many states, which better explains the overall behavior, even if a user would never see the screen in that particular way.
Bacon references Klee a lot, who has similar ideas for representing the natural world, including cubist-like thoughts.
