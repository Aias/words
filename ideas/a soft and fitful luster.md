# a soft and fitful luster 

(why the double diamond model has lost its [shine][luster])

There comes a point in every designer's growth when the capacity (compulsion?) for problem solving turns back on itself, and starts to think not about designing experiences or products or graphics, but about designing design.

In the lucky ones, this phase is short-lived, and rightfully dismissed as too esoteric to be of any real value. They continue to be great designers without feeling the need to get all introspective about it.

> I well-remember an occasion in 1962 when, in a remote Iranian village, I asked a blacksmith famous for his superior penknives to tell me the difference between iron and steel. “What’s the difference?” he replied. “What’s the difference between an oak tree and a willow — they have different natures and one must adapt to them.” He did not accept the suggestion that some material absorbed from the fire’s charcoal might have something to do with it, and he would not have understood a word of any lecture I could have given him on diffusion, crystal structure, and phase transformations; yet he could make a good knife and I could not.

But as Christopher Nolan warns us, sometimes an idea grows like a virus.

The history of meta-design is a history of models.

Now we have to name this thing.

In the horizontally symmetric version, this new representation seems almost bug-like. If we drew some legs on the side we would risk our new idea scurrying away.

But if we fold the redundant half back across the horizon line, then we arrive at something less creepy crawly and a bit more rugged – appropriate for the messiness and unpredictability of design. In this new form I might call it the Mountain Model, which retains some of the alliterative allure of the original. Different enough from the double diamond to be conceptually meaningful, but similar enough to be understood.

The wealth of this metaphor could be mined indefinitely: It suggests a real and deliberate effort by the climber, an uphill and a downhill, where the double diamond is merely expansion. It suggests the possibility of a full mountain range, with all kinds of unexpected terrain, as opposed to a neat little hinge between two otherwise disjoint units. And finally, as any good sherpa could tell us, the tallest peaks should not be attempted alone – you'll get there faster and safer if you work as a team.

Where the 🔷🔷 suggests (bad), the 🏔 suggests (good). (Repeat)
