For Monday, also gently suggest a kind of three strikes policy. If I commit code that ends up causing more problems than it solves, or degrades the user experience, I immediately lose privileges to commit unreviewed code in the future.

Maybe it's more like "one big strike" policy. Anything that we find that is not a minor problem or can't be fixed within a few hours of identifying it.

This isn't a policy I think should just apply to me either. I think we should allow anyone who sincerely believes they are improving the codebase to do so without miles of red tape, until it becomes clear that privilege should no longer apply. This is why we have unit test thresholds, build checks, etc. Trust each other and treat each other like adults who are good at what they do, until proven otherwise.

Are there examples of other companies with similar cultures of trust?

Trust each other to request reviews when they judge it to be necessary. Also trust each other to bypass the review process if they are reasonably confident it isn't necessary.

It is an interesting problem to have not too much work to do, but too much work that *has been done.*


It is interesting to me that our problem in this case is not "we have too much work to do and not enough time to get it done", but instead "we have too much work we've already done, and not enough time to review it.

Look up Steve Jobs stuff here, lots of good insight on working with and trusting smart people

Another point to make: appeal to the product team

I could submit 3 or 4 PRs of this size every single week. Wouldn’t it be nice to be able to compile a list of release notes with 3 or 4 UX notable UX enhancements *every single week*? Can you imagine the good will that would generate from our users, who could read those notes and see that we’re making steady improvements to their daily experience with the system? Can you imagine how that might look for our sales team, who can point to the release notes and say “look how much we’re doing for our users”, look at the attention to detail and care about the little things, the problems that users endure but never ask to fix because they don’t rise to the level of dealbreakers.
