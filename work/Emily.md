# Emily

If the role of a designer can be distilled to a kind of fundamental flexibility – the ability, in any context, to use the right tools, the right information, the right abstractions – then I can think of no better representative of our profession.

Emily is one of the strongest all-around designers I’ve had the pleasure of working with, naturally moving between projects, platforms, teams, apps, and processes as if this constant change were the most natural state of the world. From conducting user interviews to organizing research, from designing flows, wireframes, and polished interfaces to testing and reporting on the results, the surface area of Emily’s influence at LogRhythm was global, always guided by a keen intention and deep compassion for her teammates and users.

Any company looking to expand their design team or improve their product would benefit from Emily’s talent. As she looks to her next role, I would advise anyone hiring to be proactive in reaching out, as I expect the window of opportunity may quickly close.
