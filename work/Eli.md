# Eli

Extending an offer to Eli was the best decision I made during my time as hiring manager at LogRhythm. To think it almost didn’t happen on account of (my) poor planning and miscommunication – our organization would never have known the talent it missed out on, and would have been all the worse for it.

Over the course of roughly two years, I’ve seen Eli turn from passionate-but-green ex-architect, to fledgling software designer, to an indispensable member of our team, consistently delivering novel, usable, and beautiful solutions to the complex problems of an enterprise cybersecurity platform. Along with an unmatched natural aesthetic sense, Eli has a strong sense of motivated purpose. In a tough remote environment prone to personality clashes and organizational tensions, Eli’s communication style – empathetic, efficient, positive, pragmatic (I could go on) – consistently brought cross-functional groups together to ship high-quality projects that our users loved.

In fewer words: Eli would make a great addition to your team. Hire him, if you have the chance. What reputation I have, I would stake on that decision paying off, as it did for me.
