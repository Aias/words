# Cover Letter for MongoDB Design Systems Director

I remember there was a point in time, after Kelsey and I had both left Epic, where a similar (maybe more junior) design opportunity at MongoDB presented itself. And I remember I wanted to give it a shot, and maybe even sent in an application, but the circumstances just didn't work out.

Now, seeing the design systems director role posted years later, it seems most of what I've oriented my career around in the meantime has helped create a much more favorable set of circumstances.

Since leaving Epic, I've focused on design systems, component libraries, style guides, front-end frameworks, and design engineering regardless of organization or official role.

I worked at a small healthcare startup called Genospace, where I started as a senior designer before becoming the design manager. A major part of that job involved working with an offshore front-end contractor to maintain and evolve the design system, with a particular focus on shared components for analytics and data visualization.

This led into my own contracting role at LogRhythm, a respected cybersecurity platform where I began as an information designer and led the design and implementation of robust charting library in the spirit of ggplot, based on d3.js and VisX. I moved from contractor to full-time employee as LogRhythm's design principal, and built our Figma design system from scratch – a customized implementation of Material UI which was perhaps too ambitious, to the point that I started contributing directly to the codebase: keeping the front-end aligned with Figma, maintaining Storybook documentation, upgrading dependencies, and improving the semantics and accessibility of our custom components.

As LogRhythm has recently merged with Exabeam, all of these old problems are new again, in different ways, but I'm ready for a change.

It would be a dream come true to apply these years of experience to the challenges that MongoDB is facing, and it would be truly exciting to work alongside Kelsey Marshall again – a true force of nature at Epic (which I am sure has not changed), and without whom I would not be where I am today. 

I care deeply about craft, about beauty, about details. About maintenance and repair, leadership and pedagogy, learning and connecting, systems and networks. About removing barriers between designing and building (my LinkedIn headline has read "Digital designer-builder" since I first made an account). About doing everything "all the way through," even when you're the only one who will ever see the insides. It seems like these values align well with those of MongoDB.

I'd love to chat more about the opportunity. Thank you for your consideration, and please reach out any time.
