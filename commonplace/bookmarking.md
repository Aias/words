Before we can enjoy [this particular book][1] for ourselves, Grootens requires something of us. He asks only for a small contribution.

He asks that we mark the book.

Many of the pages are bound shut together and so the only way to read them is to potentially risk damaging the content by ripping the seams apart. In order to examine Grootens’ work then, we’re asked to leave clues and traces of our reading. You might pre-emptively roll your eyes at this but the book is not just an artisanal piece by a contemporary graphic designer, as this act of page ripping adds something to the experience rather than becoming an annoying gimmick. First, we’re obliged to slow down and consciously take part in the unbinding. Second, the book is physically different since we began. Our mark is on it for good and so, to some extent, Grootens prepares the material within, but it’s up to us to finish it.
