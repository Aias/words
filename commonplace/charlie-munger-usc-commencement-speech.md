Well, no doubt many of you are wondering why the speaker is so old.

Well the answer is obvious: he hasn’t died yet.

* * *

__The safest way to try and get what you want is to try and deserve what you want.__

It’s such a simple idea, it’s the golden rule so to speak. You want to deliver to the world what you would buy if you were on the other end.

* * *

__There is no love that’s so right as admiration-based love.__

* * *

__Wisdom acquisition is a moral duty.__

If you take Warren Buffett and watched him with a time clock, I would say half of all the time he spends is sitting on his ass and reading. And a big chunk of the rest of the time is spent talking one-on-one either on the telephone or personally with highly gifted people whom he trusts and who trust him. In other words, it looks quite academic all this worldly success.

* * *

__Learn all the big ideas in all the big disciplines.__

Cicero is famous for saying, “A man who doesn’t know what happened before he was born goes through life like a child.” That is a very correct idea of Cicero’s. And he’s right to ridicule somebody so foolish as not to know what happened before he was born.

But if you generalize Cicero as I think one should, there are all these other things that you should know in addition to history and those other things are the big ideas in all the other disciplines. And it doesn’t help you just to know them enough just so you can prattle them back on an exam and get an A. You have to learn these things in such a way that they’re in a mental latticework in your head and you automatically use them for the rest of your life.

* * *

__Learn sometimes to keep your light under a bushel.__

One of my colleagues, also number one in his class in law school, a great success in life, clerk for the supreme court, etc. But he knew a lot and he tended to show it as a very young lawyer and one day the senior partner called him in and said, “Listen Chuck, I want to explain something to you. Your duty under any circumstances is to behave in such a way that the client thinks he’s the smartest person in the world. If you have any little energy and insight available after that, use it to make your senior partner look like the smartest person in the world. And only after you’ve satisfied those two obligations do you want your light to shine at all.”

Well, that may be very good advice for rising in a large firm. But it wasn’t what I did. I always obeyed the drift of my nature and if other people didn’t like it, well I didn’t need to be adored by everybody.

* * *

__Problems frequently get easier and I would even say usually are easier to solve if you turn them around in reverse.__  

In other words if you want to help India, the question you should ask is not “how can I help India?”, you think “what’s doing the worst damage in India? What would automatically do the worst damage and how do I avoid it?”

* * *

I have what I call an iron prescription that helps me keep sane when I naturally drift toward preferring one ideology over another. And that is I say __“I’m not entitled to have an opinion on this subject unless I can state the arguments against my position better than the people do who are supporting it.”__ I think only when I reach that state am I qualified to speak.

* * *

Generally speaking, __envy, resentment, revenge, and self-pity are disastrous modes of thought.__ Self-pity gets pretty close to paranoia, and paranoia is one of the very hardest things to reverse. You do not want to drift into self-pity.

* * *

Ben Franklin said, __“If you want to persuade, appeal to interest not to reason.”__ The self-serving bias is so extreme.

You want to appeal to interest. You want to do it of lofty motives, but you should not avoid appealing to interest.

* * *

Another thing, perverse incentives. __You don’t want to be in a perverse incentive system that’s causing you to behave more and more foolishly or worse and worse.__

Incentives are too powerful a controller of human cognition and human behavior and one of the things you are going to find in some modern law firms is billable hour quotas. And I could not have lived under a billable hour quota of 2,400 hours a year. That would have caused serious problems for me, I wouldn’t have done it and I don’t have a solution for that for you, you’ll have to figure it out for yourself. But it’s a significant problem.

Perverse associations, also to be avoided. And __you particularly want to avoid working directly under somebody you really don’t admire and don’t want to be like.__

It’s very dangerous. We are all subject to control to some extent by authority figures, particularly authority figures that are rewarding us.

And that requires some talent. The way I solved that is I figured out the people I did admire and I maneuvered cleverly without criticizing anybody so I was working entirely under people I admired.

* * *

__Objectivity maintenance.__

We all remember that Darwin paid special attention to disconfirming evidence, particularly when it disconfirmed something he believed and loved.

__Non-egality.__

I think the game of life in many respects is getting a lot of practice into the hands of the people that have the most aptitude to learn and the most tendency to be learning machines.

You do not want to choose a brain surgeon for your child among fifty applicants, all of them just taking turns during the procedure.

You don’t want your airplanes designed that way.

You don’t want your Berkshire Hathaway’s run that way.

You want to get the power into the right people.

* * *

I frequently tell the story of Max Planck when he won the Nobel prize and went around Germany giving lectures on quantum mechanics, and the chauffeur gradually memorized the lecture and he said, “Would you mind Professor Planck, because it’s so boring just staying in our routines, would you mind if I gave the lecture this time and you just sat in front with my chauffeur’s hat?” And Planck said, “Sure.”

And the chauffeur got up and gave this long lecture on quantum mechanics after which a physics professor stood up in the rear and asked a perfectly ghastly question and the chauffeur said, “Well, I’m surprised that in an advanced city like Munich I get such an elementary question, I’m going to ask my chauffeur to reply.”

Well the reason I tell that story is not entirely to celebrate the quick-wittedness of the protagonist.
In this world we have two kinds of knowledge” one is __Planck knowledge__ – the people who really know, they’ve paid the dues they have the aptitude.

Then we’ve got __chauffeur knowledge__ – they have learned to prattle the talk. They have a big head of hair, they have a fine temper in the voice, they make a hell of an impression, but in the end they’ve got chauffeur knowledge… I think I’ve just described practically every politician in the United States.

* * *

Another thing that I found is that an __intense interest in the subject is indispensable if you are really going to excel.__ I could force myself to be fairly good in a lot of things, but I couldn’t be really good in anything where I didn’t have an intense interest, so to some extent you’re going to have to follow me.

If at all feasible you want to drift into doing something in which you really have a natural interest.
Another thing you have to do of course is have a lot of assiduity. I like that word because it means sit down on your ass until you do it.

* * *

Another thing of course is life will have terrible blows in it, horrible blows, unfair blows, doesn’t matter. And some people recover and others don’t. And there I think the attitude of Epictetus is the best. He thought that every mischance in life was an opportunity to behave well, every mischance in life was an opportunity to learn something and that your duty was not to be submerged in self-pity but to utilize the terrible blow in a constructive fashion.

You may remember the epitaph which Epictetus left for himself, __“Here lies Epictetus, a slave, maimed in body, the ultimate in poverty, and favored of the gods.”__

* * *

*“The thoughts of others*
*were light and fleeting,*
*of lovers’ meeting*
*or luck or fame.*
*Mine were of trouble,*
*and mine were steady;*
*So I was ready*
*when trouble came.”*

You can say, “Who wants to go through life anticipating trouble?” Well I did! All my life I’ve gone through life anticipating trouble and here I am well along on my 84th year and like Epictetus I’ve had a favored life.
It didn’t make me unhappy to anticipate trouble all the time and be ready to perform adequately if trouble came. It didn’t hurt me at all.

* * *

The last idea that I want to give to you as you go out into a profession that frequently puts a lot of procedure and a lot of precautions and a lot of mumbo jumbo into what it does: this is not the highest form which civilization can reach. __The highest form which civilization can reach is a seamless web of deserved trust.__ Not much procedure just totally reliable people correctly trusting one another. That’s the way an operating room works at the Mayo Clinic.

If a bunch of lawyers were to introduce a lot of process the patients would all die.

So never forget when you’re a lawyer that you may be rewarded for selling this stuff but you don’t have to buy it.

In your own life what you want is a seamless web of deserved trust. And if your proposed marriage contract has 47 pages my suggestion is do not enter.
