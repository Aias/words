Here’s a generally accepted view of education: *A professor has knowledge, and is going to give it to students*. This is how many fields are taught; this is how I attempted to learn statistics. I sat in a large room, and a professor stood in the front, and talked at us. The educational environment was optimized around this form of exchange – for the movement of content from one person to a mass number of people. In fact, all of the supporting structures were created to aid in the idea of mass content movement. The TAs taught “recitation” sections, in order to reiterate what the professor said but in smaller groups. The multiple-choice assessment was used to judge effectiveness across hundreds of people. It’s a machine approach to education, one where the goal is *efficient knowledge transfer*.  

There’s another approach to learning, one that I subscribe to. In this version of education, the professor has had experiences of a certain style, and is going to *try to help students encounter experiences of a similar style*. And, through various activities and conversations, students will reflect on their own experiences together, gaining a form of “meta education”, or education about the education. The professor has knowledge, but there’s no expectation that they will “give” the knowledge to students. Instead, by having experiences with shared attributes, students will develop the knowledge on their own, and __will therefore have a more associative and deep meaningful relationship with that knowledge__. They will understand the context of the knowledge, and what’s more, they will have experiential hooks into the knowledge: richer neural pathways through which they can retrieve that knowledge later.
