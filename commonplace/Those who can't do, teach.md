>” Mathematics is an art, and art should be taught by working artists, or if not, at least by people who appreciate the art form and can recognize it when they see it. It is not necessary that you learn music from a professional composer, but would you want yourself or your child to be taught by someone who doesn’t even play an instrument, and has never listened to a piece of music in their lives? Would you accept as an art teacher someone who has never picked up a pencil or stepped foot in a museum? Why is it that we accept math teachers who have never produced an original piece of mathematics, know nothing of the history and philosophy of the subject, nothing about recent developments, nothing in fact beyond what they are expected to present to their unfortunate students? What kind of a teacher is that? How can someone teach something that they themselves don’t do?"

Okay. Now, let's think about the sort of people that we typically think about when we hear the word "teacher". Say, high school teachers. I might believe there's a history teacher who spends her evenings reading contemporary accounts of the civil war, or a writing teacher who submits short fiction to the local literary journal.

But how many high school calculus teachers spend their evenings *doing calculus?* (What would that even *mean?*) Can you imagine a geometry teacher spending his evenings writing faux-formal proofs with modus ponens? Do algebra teachers even use algebra? Do they *depend* on it?

Can you trust a teacher who doesn't use what he teaches? Who has *never* used what he teaches? Can you trust a teacher whose only connection to a subject is *teaching* it?

How can such a teacher know if what he's teaching is valuable, or how well he's teaching it? ("Curricula" and "exams", respectively, are horrendous answers to those questions.)

Real teaching is not about transferring "the material", as if knowledge were some sort of mass-produced commodity that ships from Amazon. Real teaching is about conveying a *way of thinking.* How can a teacher convey a way of thinking when he doesn't genuinely think that way?

I'm sure many teachers spend their evenings thinking about *teaching* the subject. I have no doubt that these teachers love teaching, and love their students. But to me, that seems like a chef who loves *cooking,* but doesn't love *food.* Who has never *tasted* his own food. This chef might have the best of intentions, but someone in need of a satisfying meal is probably better off elsewhere.
