If the set of design requirements can be outlined as a graph, nodes & links, as in Notes on the Synthesis of Form, then what might the beta skeleton of that graph mean?

* * *

In [computational geometry][1] and [geometric graph theory][2], a __*β*____\-skeleton__ or __beta skeleton__ is an [undirected graph][3] defined from a set of points in the [Euclidean plane][4]. Two points *p* and *q* are connected by an edge whenever all the angles *prq* are sharper than a threshold determined from the numerical parameter *β*.

In [mathematics][6], a __Voronoi diagram__ is a [partitioning][7] of a [plane][8] into regions based on distance to points in a specific subset of the plane. That set of points (called seeds, sites, or generators) is specified beforehand, and for each seed there is a corresponding region consisting of all points closer to that seed than to any other. These regions are called Voronoi cells. The Voronoi diagram of a set of points is [dual][9] to its [Delaunay triangulation][10].

In [geometry][12], a __straight skeleton__ is a method of representing a [polygon][13] by a [topological skeleton][14]. It is similar in some ways to the [medial axis][15] but differs in that the skeleton is composed of straight line segments, while the medial axis of a polygon may involve parabolic curves. However, both are [homotopy-equivalent][16] to the underlying polygon.
