In my own story, I am the villain.

We secretly know that being seen as nice is the same as being nice in actuality…If you act nice, you’re nice. That’s the whole equation. Nobody cares why you say thank you. Nobody is supposed to care; weirdly this is something we’re never supposed to question. It’s impractical to incessantly interrogate the veracity of every stranger who seems like a blandly nice citizen. It’s rude. Until proven otherwise, we just accept goodness at face value.

But this is not how it works with badness.

If someone wants to be perceived as a bad person, it’s immediately assumed to have a wider ulterior purpose. Decency is its own reward, but purposeful depravity requires an upside.

So this, I suspect, is where we really begin: In any situation, the villain is the person who knows the most but cares the least.
