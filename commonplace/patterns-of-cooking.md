Here's the secret of cooking: __it's all about patterns.__ Every recipe you see is a chef applying one or more patterns to create something uniquely theirs. When you learn enough recipes, you pick up on these patterns and you can start using them to improvise new meals.  

The most useful pattern I know of is something I call the BASE Recipe.
1.  __Brown__ meat in hot fat,
2.  saute __Aromatic__ vegetables like onion, garlic and peppers,
3.  __Simmer__ in a flavorful liquid like stock, broth, wine, tomato juice, milk, or cream, and
4.  finish with __Extras__ like a splash of lemon juice, fresh herbs, or a sprinkling of cheese.
Pair it with an appropriate starch and you have the template to make billions of unique meals. Soups, stews, braises, sauces, curries, risottos and so much more follow this pattern, only differing in the cooking vessel, the choice and ratios of ingredients used, and the cook time.

Want a soup? Use a lot of liquid in the simmering phase. Common aromatics are onions, carrots, and celery (mirepoix) and a common simmering liquid is chicken stock. Finish with a splash of lemon.
Want a stew? Cook in a dutch oven, make the simmering liquid come about halfway up through the ingredients, and simmer on low for several hours, preferably in an oven. Common simmering liquids are wine, stock, and tomato juice.

Sauce? Use a moderate amount of liquid and add a thickening agent, like a roux or cornstarch. Another strategy is to make a braise using the previous technique, then strain out the solids and reduce the liquid down to a sauce. Tomatos count as both a liquid and a thickening agent in my opinion, so tomato sauce rarely needs additional thickeners.

Pan Sauce? Use a very small amount of liquid, usually wine, just enough to deglaze the bottom and scrape up all the delicious fond. Finish with butter and fresh herbs. Common aromatics are shallots and garlic.

Stir Fry? Cook in a wok (if you have one) and keep the heat high. The liquid, while perhaps not exactly "simmered" should be a small amount of a very strongly flavored liquid, like soy sauce and vinegar. Garlic, ginger, and scallions are common aromatics.

Risotto? Toast rice in the pan after sauteing the aromatics, and gradually add liquid (usually stock and wine) little by little to let the rice absorb all the flavor. Finish with fresh grated cheese. Spanish rice is very similar except you put in all the liquid at once. Replace the rice with pasta and you have one-pot pasta.

Curries? They pretty much follow the pattern to the letter. Common simmering liquids include coconut milk, broth, and tomatos.

Many more recipes follow some, but not all of these phases. Classic pasta dishes like aglio e olio and cacio e pepe lack a browning phase but otherwise follow the pattern with garlic as a common aromatic. Fajitas and other recipes for filling burritos or tacos often lack a liquid phase (aside from whatever juices seep out of the sauted vegetables) but otherwise follow the pattern of browning meat, sauteing aromatics, and finishing with an acid like lime juice.
As you can see, the techniques for different kinds of meals are very similar except for cooking time. What really sets dishes apart are the particular pairings of ingredients used. These ingredients fall into a smaller number of "roles". How do you become a person who can make up a meal out of whatever's lying around? Simple, you have at least one ingredient for each "role", and then decide on a technique to bring them together. You should come up with a few go-to ingredients for each role and have them in your kitchen at all times.

First you need a searing fat, that is one that can stand up to high temperatures. You can find plenty of lists online of oils by their smoke point but for searing you want something that can take at least 400 degrees if not more. My go-to is refined (not extra virgin) olive oil.

You'll also need a fat for low and medium heat cooking. You can use the same fat, but at lower temperatures you have a lot more options. And by "a lot more options" I mean butter. It's also common to use rendered animal fats like lard or schmaltz to add extra flavor. Many recipes start by rendering the fat out of some kind of pork, like lardons, pancetta, or bacon, and using that fat to cook everything else. Try cooking eggs in a tablespoon or two of the fat from your morning bacon!

Next you'll want aromatic vegetables, so called because they smell nice when cooked. If you walk into the kitchen and think "That smells really good!" you can probably thank the aromatics. But nice as aromas are, what you're really after is the flavor they impart into the oil or cooking liquids. Aromatic vegetables include onions, shallots, scallions, leeks, garlic, celery, carrots, ginger, and all manner of peppers (hot and sweet). Many world cuisines are defined by the particular blend of aromatics they use. [Here][1] is a great guide with several examples. Of all aromatics, I find onion and garlic to be the most versatile. You can almost never go wrong with onion and garlic.

The simmering liquid is perhaps one of the most important roles to play. The sauce or broth is often the most obvious flavor you will taste, and it ties together the flavors of all the other ingredients. I divide liquids into Loud, Medium, and Quiet flavors. Loud flavors are very strong and can easily overpower a dish if you use too much. Some examples are vinegar, lemon juice, soy sauce, and fish sauce. Quiet flavors provide more of a backdrop to carry the other flavors. Stock is the perfect example, chicken stock in particular is suitable for just about any recipe needing a flavorful liquid. Water is, of course, the ultimate "quiet" flavored liquid (starchy water also doubles as a thickening agent). Medium flavors are things like wine, spirits, tomato juice, and cream. They have a lot of flavor and can overpower a dish if misused, but not so much flavor that they can't be used in large quantities. In general your simmering liquid should be mostly quiet flavors, backed up by medium flavors, with a small dash of loud flavors. Refer to recipes for examples of good ratios between each. Think of "quiet" as a liquid you could chug, "medium" as a liquid you could sip over time, and "loud" as a liquid that you probably wouldn't ever want to drink directly.
Finally the "extras", the ingredients you add either very late in cooking or even at the table itself. As a general rule of thumb, the less something is cooked, the more it will retain its own flavor, while something cooked for a long time will meld together with other flavors. So the "extras" provide a way to get some contrast. Perhaps the most useful of the extras is a splash of acid, like lemon juice, lime juice, or vinegar. A little bit is often said to "wake up" a dish. Fat is often the first thing to go into the pan, but it can also be the last. A "finishing fat", like a pat of butter, a dollop of sour cream, or a glug of heavy cream, can provide extra flavor and a creamy mouthfeel. Cheese, especially high quality cheeses, can be grated directly onto the plate. Fresh herbs, which lose their flavor quickly, are also often best added late.

There are plenty more __roles__ like "thickening agent" or "umami bomb", which you will notice after seeing enough recipes. As you cook recipes, try to notice how they are using their ingredients. __Instead of seeing recipes as steps to be followed, try to see them as applications of patterns. Pay attention to ingredients and techniques that are used in many different recipes and you'll often find a pattern underlying them all.__ Try to take a piece of one recipe and use it in another. If it works out well, congratulations, you just discovered a pattern! At some point, you will stop thinking of food in terms of "recipes" and start think more along the lines of techniques and flavor pairings. This turns cooking from a chore of obeying instructions into a creative, fun, and stress free part of your daily life.
