"*Mens et Manus*" (latin for "Mind and Hand") is the official motto of MIT. Lots of schools have Latin mottoes, and they are usually pretty bland. But *mens et manus* was — and still is — a radical social statement.

It says that *knowing* and *doing* are equally important. It's radical because the traditional academy and aristocratic class believed that *doing* was lesser work for lesser people. They were concerned only with knowing. *"Veritas**”*.

MIT is a world-leading place today because it turns out you can't really be great at *knowing* without also *doing*. You can't do cutting edge science without doing cutting-edge engineering to make new tools and gather better data. The closer you look, the fuzzier the distinction gets. *"Mens et manus"* is a statement that you aren't fully-educated until you appreciate both sides of the coin.

There is still plenty of social resistance to *mens et manus*. Many organizations are structured as if one caste of leaders should do all the thinking, and another caste of workers should do all the doing.

Nowhere is that attitude more self-defeating than in software. Because software is one of the purest embodiments of the *mens et manus* duality: __the act of knowing *precisely* what the software needs to do is identical to the act of *making* the software__. But you can't know precisely what it needs to do until you try to make it.
