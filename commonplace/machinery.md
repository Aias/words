If I were a living person of blood and flesh I would have collapsed from the pain. There definitely was a being called *me* right there. And accompanying that is a consciousness that is the self. But at that point, I had to force myself to think that those were convenient forms and nothing more. It’s a strange way of thinking and definitely a very strange feeling – consciousness trying to deny consciousness. You have to force yourself into an inorganic place. Instinctively I realized that this was the only way to survive.

*I’m not a human. I’m a piece of machinery. I don’t need to feel. Just forge on ahead.*
I repeat this like a mantra. A literal, mechanical repetition. And I try hard to reduce the perceptible world to the narrowest parameters. All I can see is the ground three yards ahead, nothing beyond. My whole world consists of the ground three yards ahead. No need to think beyond that. The sky and wind, the grass, the cows munching the grass, the spectators, cheers, lake, novels, reality, the past, memory – these mean nothing to me. Just getting me past the next three yards – *this* was my tiny reason for living as a human. No, I’m sorry – as a *machine.*
