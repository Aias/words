Wabi-sabi, in its purest, most idealized form, is precisely about these delicate traces, this faint evidence, at the borders of nothingness.

Within the tea room, as within all places wabi-sari, every single object seems to expand in importance in inverse proportion to its actual size.

Things wabi-sari are unstudied and inevitable looking. They do not blare out “I am important” or demand to be the center of attention. They are understated and unassuming, yet not without presence or quiet authority. Things wabi-sari easily coexist with the rest of their environment.

Things wabi-sari are appreciated only during direct contact and use; they are never locked away in a museum. Things wabi-sari have no need for reassurance of status or the validation of market culture. They have no need for documentation of provenance. Wabi-sabiness in no way depends on knowledge of the creator’s background or personality. In fact, it is best if the creator is of no distinction, invisible, or anonymous.

*There is no ego.*

Wabi-sabi is antithetical to the idea of “universal archetypes,” the notion that certain prototypical objects can aesthetically function at any scale. From a wabi-sari perspective the density of information contained within an object changes, as does the human relatability, when the scale does. Certainly the design consideration of a cabinet and a house are different. Yet some architects treat the design of a building as if it were no more than a blown-up piece of furniture.
