The author has a very personal way to show how every minor thing surrounding us has some sort of *weight* on our perception. I purposefully used the word weight to which she dedicates a whole chapter, titled “*Don’t Take This Lightly: The Importance of Weight*” in which she enlists several figures of speech for weight: “weighing one options”, “carrying a lot of weight”, “weighted down”, “the weight of the world”. The importance of weight is that weight is a synonym for something important, and this affects our way to look at things that are (or appear to be) physically heavy. It’s the main reason why many ancient buildings and monuments were built with heavy materials and huge in size — think of the pyramids or the great wall of China.
