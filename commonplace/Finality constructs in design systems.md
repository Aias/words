One particular term of importance from the aforementioned article is the dilution effect which states that a multifinal means is perceived to be less instrumental due to its linkages with multiple goals. For example, a pen with a laser pointer is usually perceived to be less instrumental to the task of writing than a regular pen. Its strength of association to any single one of its goals is diluted. A pen that is associated with only one goal is part of a unifinal relationship (e.g. writing), and is perceived to be more instrumental at achieving one single goal than a multifinal means.
