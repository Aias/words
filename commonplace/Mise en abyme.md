In [Western art history][1], __*Mise en abyme*__ (French pronunciation: [\[miz ɑ̃n‿abim\]][2]; also __*mise en abîme*__) is a formal technique of placing a copy of an image within itself, often in a way that suggests an infinitely recurring sequence. In film theory and literary theory, it refers to the technique of inserting a story within a story. The term is derived from [heraldry][3] and literally means "placed into [abyss][4]". It was first appropriated for modern criticism by the French author [André Gide][5].

A common sense of the phrase is the visual experience of standing between two [mirrors][6], seeing as a result an infinite reproduction of one's image.[\[1\]][7] Another is the [Droste effect][8], in which a picture appears within itself, in a place where a similar picture would realistically be expected to appear.[\[2\]][9] That is named after the 1904 [Droste][10] cocoa package, which depicts a woman holding a tray bearing a Droste cocoa package, which bears a smaller version of her image.
