Most prohibitive signs are there because the proprietors of an establishment were sick and tired of people doing X, so they made a sign asking them to please *not*. If you go into one of those fifty year old ma-and-pa diners, like the Yankee Doodle in New Haven, the walls are *covered* with signs saying things like “Please don’t put your knapsack on the counter,” more anthropological evidence that people used to put their knapsacks on the counter a lot. By the age of the sign you can figure out when knapsacks were popular among local students.

Sometimes they’re harder to figure out. “Please do not bring glass bottles into the park” must mean that somebody cut themselves stepping on broken glass while walking barefoot through the grass once, and it’s a good bet they sued the city.

__Software has a similar archaeological record__, too: it’s called the Options dialog. Pull up the Tools | Options dialog box and you will see a history of arguments that the software designers had about the design of the product. Should we automatically open the last file that the user was working on? Yes! No! There is a two week debate, nobody wants to hurt anyone’s feelings, the programmer puts in an `ifdef` in self defense while the designers fight it out. Eventually they just decide to make it an option.
