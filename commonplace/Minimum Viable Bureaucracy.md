Any time someone new joins, they need to be onboarded, which means you are getting a free 3rd party audit of your processes. They will run into the stumbling blocks and pitfalls you step over without thinking. They will extract the information that nobody realizes only exists in everyone's heads. They will ask the obvious questions that haven't actually been written down yet, or even asked.
