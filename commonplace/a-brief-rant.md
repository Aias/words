On the future of interaction design.

So, here's a Vision Of The Future that's popular right now. It's a lot of this sort of thing.

![](A%20brief%20rant.html.resources/466D7EFE-ACBA-4838-92EA-28C30DADC38D.png)  

This vision, from an interaction perspective, is *not visionary*. It's a timid increment from the status quo, and the status quo, from an interaction perspective, is *terrible*.

Before we think about how we should interact with our Tools Of The Future, let's consider what a tool is in the first place. I like this definition: A tool addresses __human needs__ by amplifying __human capabilities__. That is, a tool converts what we *can do* into what we *want to do*. A great tool is designed to fit both sides.

Go ahead and pick up a book. Open it up to some page.

Notice how you *know* where you are in the book by the distribution of weight in each hand, and the thickness of the page stacks between your fingers. Turn a page, and notice how you would *know* if you grabbed two pages together, by how they would slip apart when you rub them against each other.

Go ahead and pick up a glass of water. Take a sip.

Notice how you *know* how much water is left, by how the weight shifts in response to you tipping it.

Almost *every object in the world* offers this sort of feedback. It's so taken for granted that we're usually not even aware of it. Take a moment to pick up the objects around you. Use them as you normally would, and sense their tactile response â€” their texture, pliability, temperature; their distribution of weight; their edges, curves, and ridges; how they *respond* in your hand as you use them.

There's a reason that our fingertips have some of the densest areas of nerve endings on the body. This is how we experience the world close-up. This is how our tools talk to us. The sense of touch is essential to everything that humans have called "work" for millions of years.

Now, take out your favorite Magical And Revolutionary Technology Device. Use it for a bit.

What did you feel? Did it feel *glassy*? Did it have *no connection whatsoever* with the task you were performing?

I call this technology __Pictures Under Glass__. Pictures Under Glass sacrifice all the tactile richness of working with our hands, offering instead a hokey visual facade.

To me, claiming that Pictures Under Glass is the future of interaction is like claiming that black-and-white is the future of photography. It's *obviously* a transitional technology. And the sooner we transition, the better.

The next time you make a sandwich, pay attention to your hands. Seriously! Notice the myriad little tricks your fingers have for manipulating the ingredients and the utensils and all the other objects involved in this enterprise. Then compare your experience to sliding around Pictures Under Glass.

Are we really going to accept an Interface Of The Future that is less expressive than a *sandwich?*

Our hands feel things, and our hands manipulate things. Why aim for anything less than a __dynamic medium that we can see, feel, and manipulate?__

Let's start using our hands.
