The __XY problem__ is a communication problem encountered in [help desk][1] and similar situations in which the real issue ("*X*") of the person asking for help is obscured, because instead of asking directly about issue *X*, they ask how to solve a secondary issue ("*Y*") which they believe will allow them to resolve issue *X*. However, resolving issue *Y* often does not resolve issue *X*, or is a poor way to resolve it, and the obscuring of the real issue and the introduction of the potentially strange secondary issue can lead to the person trying to help having unnecessary difficulties in communication and offering poor solutions.

The XY problem is commonly encountered in [technical support][2] or [customer service][3] environments where the end user has attempted to solve the problem on their own, and misunderstands the real nature of the problem, believing that their real problem *X* has already been solved, except for some small detail *Y* in their solution. The inability of the support personnel to resolve their real problem or to understand the nature of their enquiry may cause the end user to become frustrated. The situation can make itself clear if the end user asks about some seemingly inane detail which is disconnected from any useful end goal. The solution for the support personnel is to [ask probing questions][4] as to why the information is needed, in order to identify the root problem and redirect the end user away from an unproductive path of inquiry.
