Few teams I’ve encountered have actionable metrics associated with the real experiences of their users. I can count on one hand the number of teams I’ve worked with who have goals that allow them to block launches for latency regressions, including Google products. Nearly all developers in the modern frontend shops *do not experience performance constraints until it’s too late*. The brakes aren’t applied until performance is so poor that it actively hurts the business.
