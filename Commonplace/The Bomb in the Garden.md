Moral haz­ard means that rather than pun­ish­ing the bad browsers for their bad be­hav­ior, you’re in­dulging them. You’re ac­com­mo­dat­ing them. So what do they do? Do they stop? No, they keep do­ing it. And you get the op­po­site of what you want. In­stead of the bad browsers com­ing into com­pli­ance, you get 10 years of your ca­reer spent fig­ur­ing out what In­ter­net Ex­plor­er 6 can do. That’s a ter­ri­ble use of a de­sign­er’s ca­reer, in my opin­ion.
