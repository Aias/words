Hashtags are a low-friction, low-commitment tool for organizing information that don't require you to mess around with metadata or complex folder structures. And theyâ€™re not just useful for shared information environments; they can also help you keep things organized in your own [personal information ecosystem][1]. Since you can use them in any app that accepts plain text, you can use them across many apps.
