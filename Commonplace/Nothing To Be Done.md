Each of these arrows represents a *design culture*: a group of designers who thought of people and considered human systems in a particular way. It’s this *shared**vision* which gave birth to institutions.

So what blocks the creation of new institutions? It’s not the greed of the powerful; it’s not some physics of balancing incentives. __We’re waiting on a new vision of human nature.__

Until we have it, we’re stuck recycling old models (unions, co-ops, local currencies, whatever) or, worse, grasping at tech trends (blockchains, wikipedia, the “sharing economy”). That’s like trying to invent voting by asking “so, fellas, what can we do with *pencils*?” Believe it or not, it wasn’t new technologies that led to new institutions in the past, it was changing ideas of human nature and society.
