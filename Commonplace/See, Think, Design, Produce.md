If I practiced something long enough, then I could take those decisions that before I had been making in my head — “Are these glyphs too close together? Are these too far apart?” — I could take those decisions and essentially outsource them to my eyes, so that my eyes started learning these patterns and raising the problem pairs to my attention.

Paper sketches are not commitments.
Sometimes I feel that if I get started too early on the computer and I make something that looks refined, then, okay, I’ve got my direction set. But maybe that’s not the best idea, that’s not the best solution.
So by forcing myself to stay on paper until I get a sort of a-ha! moment, then often I find a better direction.
Because sketches really force you to confront that problem of: “What are you trying to do?”
And if it’s just your pen and paper, you can’t hide behind a programming language or making things look cool. It kind of forces you to grapple with that question.

An ugly sketch can be a wonderful thing.
I would much rather have an ugly sketch that expresses a clear thought than a beautiful, polished sketch that has a poor idea behind it, or a weaker idea behind it.
It’s much easier to clean up an ugly sketch in the design process than it is to salvage an idea that’s not quite there.
—*An ugly sketch is not necessarily an ugly idea.*

I don’t know if there are *units* of understanding, but \[the a-ha moment is\] your one unit of understanding that all your prior work has come up with.
And you have to be very careful to remember that, and not say: “Oh, I’ll make something pretty,” and lose track of that idea. No, that aha! moment, that is the point of Seeing and of Thinking, to find that.
And once you have that, please, whatever it is that you do, keep it. And then try to communicate that understanding. Your goal becomes: “Okay, I have this little piece of understanding. How can I find a way to communicate that to others?” That runs behind most of the work that we do.
/
Don’t be your own audience!
By the time you’ve learned something, by the time you’re in the middle of something, you know too much about the topic.
And part of that is remembering what it’s like *not* to understand something. This is very important.
Whenever I work, I try to actively think: “What was it like two weeks ago, when I hadn’t done any research on this topic?”
If I could go back and talk to that person two weeks ago, how would I lead them, with no dead ends, on a simple path to whatever I’ve come to understand?

Why would we say: “Here are some numbers?”
I think that, if the work you’re doing as a designer, if that work is just summing something up to a single number, and then adding some design to it then you’re not really visualizing, you’re just counting.
So I strongly believe that, as designers, we have to do much *more* than just show we can count something accurately.

This is some data visualization clip art, sort of a “Just add numbers!” way of designing.
So this is sort of the facade of communication. It’s trying to look cool without actually communicating.
Here’s a style that is available for you to apply to your numbers, no matter what your numbers are.
It’s not: “Here’s a pattern in the data.” It’s a pattern you can kind of force, cram down your numbers’ throat.
So I try to be very careful not to do this. It can be very easy to fall into this pattern, this habit.
John Grimwade, a designer in New York, he calls this the “language of infographics.” He sees it in students’ work often, where the point of the work is to look impressive, and not to communicate.
You show someone the graphic and all they can say is “Wow.” They’re not taking anything out of it, other than “Wow.”
And you see this sort of __vanity data__ all over the place.
It was all over the World Cup: “4.9 million tweets in this match.” Or you might see it in the number of Facebook “likes” for the Boston Red Sox.
But the problem is, what is that number telling you? It’s saying there’s a lot, but compared to what? You really need some context to make any sense of the number, or to have any sort of takeaway, anything you can understand from that.

But the important thing to me is not the tool. Sometimes I’ll post a graphic and I’ll get an email from someone asking, “What tool do you use?”
It’s really not about what tool you use. For me, the more important thing is that thought process, that design process, that production process. Then you’re not grabbing a tool, or grabbing a design style, and applying it to your data. But you’re looking at data and you’re seeing what tool might help you bring out understanding from that data set. So in a way there is no fixed tool. It depends on what you’re trying to communicate.
But the important thing to me, no matter what tool I’m using, is to understand every step in the process, to understand how you get from a data point in this table to a representation of a planet orbiting a star.
I don’t want any magic steps where I feed it to a tool, then something comes out the other side and I’m not quite sure what happened.

And then maybe every once in a while, you can get a sense of beauty.
But to me beauty is really not that important. I’d much rather have an ugly graphic that communicates than a beautiful graphic that does not, that just looks nice. So I always try to make sure that the goal of understanding is ahead of beauty.
