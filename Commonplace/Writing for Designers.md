Some teams seem to build their whole process around not writing. They fill wireframes with lorem ipsum (that fake Latin text that confuses stakeholders) and write CTA goes here on their buttons. I’ve been handed my share of comps where anything remotely word-based was represented by a bunch of squiggly lines.
You know that comic about how to draw an owl? Step one: draw some circles. Step two: draw the rest of the fucking owl. That’s you with your squiggly lines. Rude.
Everything left unwritten is a mystery box of incomplete design. These mysteries beget other mysteries, and pretty soon you’ve got dozens of screens of things that kinda-sorta-maybe make sense but none of them can really be final because you never wrote the words.
Choosing words and writing what appears in an interface forces us to name components, articulate choices, and explain things to the user. It’s part of design.
We know this, don’t we? We knew it at the beginning of the design project, and yet here we are. Why did we wait?
## Writing is part of design
Words are one of the most powerful design materials available. They convey deeply complex meanings in a compact space. They load fast. They’re easy to manipulate and easy to transmit. And the best part is, you don’t have to invent any of them! You just have to use them.
Sometimes words get written off (see what I did there) as mere “details” in our designs. True details can wait until the end of your design process. Words, however, are deeply integrated throughout the user’s experience of your design. Look at your favorite app, site, or interface. Take all the words away and what do you have? Not much!
Even if the particular thing you’re designing seems light on words, take a broader view and you’ll find words hiding everywhere:-   error messages and recovery flows
-   confirmation screens
-   user-visible metadata like page titles and search engine descriptions
-   transactional emails
-   in-app user assistance
-   support documentation
-   changelogs
-   feature descriptions and marketing copy

These are as much a part of the design as the layout, graphics, and animations. Designs depend on words.
