__What’s the most confident statement that can come out of your mouth?__

> “I don’t know.”

## Confidence

Why is confidence important? It’s important for a few reasons.

Firstly, confidence is a transitive property. People feel confident about work they’re receiving when the person delivering it is doing it confidently. They want to know they hired the right person for the job. Makes them feel smart. And they *are* smart. They hired *you,* didn’t they. Show them how smart they are.

Secondly, confidence saves time. Your humility in presenting good work is expensive. It slows things down and it keeps other people from doing *their* work. If you’re not sure about what you’re showing me why should I be sure about it. Meanwhile the rest of the team is waiting on you.

Thirdly, the words you use to describe your work are the same words the people you present it to will use when they describe it. So if you want your boss to tell *her* boss the work is awesome, you need to model those words for her. Also, make sure the work is awesome.

Last but not least, and this is where our original point kicks back in, at some point during the presentation, as much as you may have prepared and practiced, the person you’re presenting to will ask you a question that stumps you. (This moment is where careers are made, btw!)

You have a few options here:

-   You can lie. But only assholes lie.
-   You can try to make something up on the fly. But they’ll see right through that, plus it’ll probably be wrong, in which case it’s a lie.
-   You can buy for time with a strategically stretched out series of *ummmmmmm*s until a co-worker bails you out. But every *ummmmmmmm* that comes out of your mouth is decreasing the room’s confidence in you.

Or, or, OR! You can say the most confident thing that has ever come out of your mouth: “I don’t know.”

Also, you need to follow that up with something like “I’m excited to find out.” or “Give me until the end of the day/week to look into it.” And then follow up.

It’s easy to look confident when you know what you’re talking about. (And to be clear, you should know what you’re talking about *most* of the time.) But on that rare occasion that you don’t, letting people know that you’re confident enough to admit that you’re at a loss is when you beat the level boss. No one has all the answers, and pretending you do doesn’t make you look confident, it makes you look a fool.

Being calm and collected while expressing a missing piece of knowledge? Amazing. Confident. If anything people’s confidence in *you* has grown. Now they trust you. They know you’ll admit when you don’t know something. And that’s huge.
