Picture marks are divided into figurative and non-figurative marks. Figurative marks depict an object. Non-figurative marks are pictures in their own right. Figurative marks are further divided into descriptive marks, metaphoric marks, and found marks.
Sometimes the nature of the object depicted in a figurative mark is forgotten and the mark will be perceived as a non-figurative mark. This has happened to the barber’s pole. The original barber’s pole was a three-dimensional figurative mark referring to the barber’s role in medical practice. Today only a few people recall the early barber’s historical function of surgery, which included bloodletting. To further the bloodletting, patients were given a pole to trip. When not in use, the pole was hung outside the barber surgeon’s shop together with the bloodstained bandage that was twisted around the patient’s arm.
