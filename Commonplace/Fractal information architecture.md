The way information architecture tends to work is that the structures are fractal. The sensible way to structure a project also turns out to be the sensible way to structure an activity also turns out to be the sensible way to structure an artifact.  

What applies to the large scale—an entire project—often can be applied all the way down to the minuscule—a single step, process, or artifact.
