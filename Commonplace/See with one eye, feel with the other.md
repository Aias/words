Learning to design is, first of all, learning to see. Designers see more, and more precisely. This is a blessing and a curse – once we have learned to see design, both good and bad, we cannot *un-see*. The downside is that the more you learn to see, the more you lose your “common” eye, the eye you design for. This can be frustrating for us designers when we work for a customer with a bad eye and strong opinions. But this is no justification for designer arrogance or eye-rolling. Part of our job is to make the invisible visible, to clearly express what we see, feel and do. You can’t expect to sell what you can’t explain.  

This is why excellent designers do not just develop a sharper eye. They try to keep their ability to see things as a customer would. You need a design eye to design, and a non-designer eye to *feel* what you designed.
"See with one eye, feel with the other.” —Paul Klee
