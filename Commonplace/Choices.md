it is the designers’ responsibility to make these choices for them so that they don’t have to. It is the height of arrogance for a software designer to inflict a choice like this on the user simply because the designer couldn’t think hard enough to decide which option is really better.

“But wait!” you say. “It’s important to have options for *advanced* users who want to tweak their environments!” In reality, it’s not as important as you think. This reminds me of when I tried to switch to a Dvorak keyboard. The trouble was, I don’t use *one* computer. I use all kinds of computers. I use other people’s computers. I use three computers fairly regularly at home and three at work. I use computers in the test lab at work. The trouble with customizing your environment is that it just doesn’t *propagate*, so it’s not even worth the trouble.
