A simple heuristic for determining if something is an attention monster: “Free” apps built around advertising models *tend* to become attention monsters. Especially if they’ve taken on a lot of venture capital, a tendency even further exacerbated if they’re a public company. Instagram is a great example. The more you scroll, the more money they make. Consider the “agreement” into which you’ve entered with the application the next time you find yourself mindlessly scrolling. What’s keeping you there? Why are the algorithms showing you what they’e showing? What benefits are you accruing? What do you feel the need to post what you’re posting? For what are are you trading your time and mental energy?
Most likely, you’re stuck in a [“tiny loop:”][1]
*— a senseless series of actions that span minutes, hours, days, consume years, and add up to nothing or almost nothing, and that benefit (ideally: tranquility, growth, curiosity) no one but the company (in reality: engagement, ad views) who owns the container in which the loop takes place.*
/
When the front page is the only entry point, only a single page of the publication requires hyperbole to convert passers-by to readers. Online, every article becomes a potential entry point. And so there is an incentive for pervasive hyperbole in order to “convert” eyeballs in service to ads and the consumption of more attention.

“If you read a novel in more than two weeks you don’t read the novel really.” Meaning: To truly read (and, I might add, write) is to commit and maintain focus long enough to live fully within the world of the book (as opposed to ten second dips in and out, as we mostly do with much online media).
[William Styron][2] put it well:
*A great book should leave you with many experiences, and slightly exhausted at the end.*
The critical insight is that deep reading is an *active* exhaustion, the result of [burned calories,][3] not the passive exhaustion of an underused body and mind.
