About 85% of my “thinking” time was spent getting into a position to think, to make a decision, to learn something I needed to know. Much more time went into finding or obtaining information than into digesting it. __Hours went into the plotting of graphs__, and other hours into instructing an assistant how to plot. __When the graphs were finished, the relations were obvious at once, but the plotting had to be done in order to make them so.__ At one point, it was necessary to compare six functions relating speech-intelligibility to speech-to-noise ratio. Several hours of calculating were required to get the data into comparable form. __When they were in comparable form, it took only a few seconds to determine what I needed to know.__
