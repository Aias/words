__Consensus is not collaboration__

It’s easy to mistake one for the other. Consensus can feel a lot more comfortable until it doesn’t. A consensus-driven process optimizes for everyone agreeing. Eliminating conflict takes precedence. A truly collaborative process allows everyone to contribute towards achieving a stated shared goal. You can work side by side with someone for a decade and never truly collaborate. A lot of teams are more comfortable sacrificing the goal than probing the disagreement.

It doesn’t matter if everyone agrees. It matters that everyone working together knows how to manage disagreement in a productive and respectful manner.

An explicit process and an external standard are both necessary to separate good candor from bad conflict.
