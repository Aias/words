In digital design, products and services are frequently imagined and implemented placelessly: as if the consumer were jacked into The Matrix, and considering this product or that product from among an infinite set of choices at an infinitely-provisioned mercantile. The things we make are good, by this way of reasoning, if they fit the market’s demand.

As a point of departure from the placelessness of contemporary thinking about digital design, I challenged them to consider the so-called timeless criteria Alexander talks about in *The Timeless Way of Building*. How might we map some of Alexander’s ideas about value, the self of the maker, and the nature of order into the work they want to do on iPhone apps and websites?

Occasionally, one or two students out of sixty would take this task up with some seriousness, and before too long would visit me in office hours to see if I could relieve them of their distress. They needed me to assure them that what Alexander says in his books isn’t…you know… *real*. For a number of reasons, not the least of which being the seeming incompatibility between how they’d been taught to think about design and what these teachings insist one must do in order to be, as they might say, “doing it right.”

And having never been to any of Alexander’s buildings, I’d simply turn the question around and ask “but what if it is real?”

My attitude toward Alexander’s teachings prior to experiencing the places and spaces realized in his practice was akin to what Alan Watts said about certain teachings in The Bible:

*Sometimes, as St. Paul pointed out, commandments are not given in the expectation that they will be obeyed, but in the expectation that they will reveal something to those who hear them.*
>   
Today, my answer is unequivocal. My interpretive lens: literal. Time and again, across cultures and continents and islands and oceans, in five different places now I’ve examined the evidence, and am persuaded.

*Nicht nur einmal: immer wieder.*

Not just once: again and again
