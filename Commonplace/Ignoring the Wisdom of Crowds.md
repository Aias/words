There’s seemingly no end to studies like these, all showing that the crowd is smarter than the individual. Is this a universal rule? Should we be leveraging this power more often?
Big companies do use crowd wisdom. You always hear about advertising campaigns being honed by [focus groups][1] of “real people.” (I’d like to see the questionnaire that distinguishes “real people” from that elusive other kind of person.)
However, company messaging, product features, advertising layouts, and the other creative aspects of business require innovation, and we know that design-by-committee is the antithesis of innovation. [Average products designed for the average consumer][2] is the path to small business failure.

__The crowd vetoes innovation__
We understand how crowds can be right, but this same process doesn’t work for creative endeavors.
Votes don’t converge on something wonderful. Rather, votes are *vetoes*.
There is “wisdom in the crowd” only when errors cancel out, like when estimating jelly beans or answering pop culture questions. In creative work, votes eliminate the interesting edges, leaving only the boring residue that no one hated enough to vote off the island.
That’s not how great products are made.
