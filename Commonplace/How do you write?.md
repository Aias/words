__"I will research and procrastinate and sort of circle an idea for as long as possible before attacking it.__

__When I finally do start scripting, I try and write the first draft very quickly.__ I even put bad dialogue and broken moments in deliberately, just to get to the end of the first draft. This is draft zero, which no one sees but me. Then I go back over it and polish it up, fixing those broken moments and getting the dialogue right, until I feel safe in handing in a proper first draft.

Then, it’s just a question of rewriting right up until, and during, the studio recording. __You’re working on a shrinking set of concerns with each draft.__ So a first draft might have a problem with a whole sequence that takes up eight pages. Then the next draft has lost that sequence and replaced it with two shorter sequences, one of which doesn’t work. The third draft gets rid of the sequence that doesn’t work and soon it’s only individual lines of dialogue or beats of action that need attention.

By the studio recording, you’re hopefully only looking at two or three lines or moments that aren’t quite hitting the target, and you can often come up with a fix on the night."
