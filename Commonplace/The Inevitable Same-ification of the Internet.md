*Relate to Alexander's pattern on distribution of similar businesses. There is a tendency for all entertainment offerings to cluster in one area, all food in another, all bars in another. Instead, we should aim for a rough homogenization of goods and services throughout an area, so that there's always a reason to be anywhere. This article talks about why, when left to their own devices, clustering of function inevitably happens, and is a great example of a situation where organic growth does not work in building better communities. When it comes to goods and services, we need a designer (or a planner) at the top who can look at the situation objectively and say “no, we don’t need six coffee shops on one street corner. You’ll need to open your business somewhere else.”*

*Top-down planning of this sort also has the added benefit (or drawback, depending on your perspective) of giving priority to the first business of a certain type in the community, since they can choose freely where they want to open shop.*

In 1929, the economist Harold Hotelling published a paper in *The Economic Journal* titled “[Stability in Competition][1].” The paper describes a strange phenomenon: “an undue tendency for competitors to imitate each other in quality of goods, in location, and in other essential ways.”

90 years later, it’s easy to see: compare McDonalds and Burger King, Pepsi and Coke, or CVS and Walgreens. But it was noticeable even in 1929, when stores opened across the street from one another selling nearly identical goods at a nearly identical price point.

Hotelling’s paper shows that the convergence of competition to nearly-identical products is not just a coincidence: it is inevitable. It seems irrational, but the math is sound. This is an *emergent* phenomenon: it’s not written into the rules. Businesses don’t need to coordinate with each other. Over time, as each business pursues its own success according to the same rules, clusters form.

Convergence is not the sign of a broken system, or a symptom of a more insidious disease. It is an emergent phenomenon that arises from a few simple rules.

It’s similar to another emergent phenomenon: a murmuration of starlings. Each bird follows three rules:

1.  __Separation__: Don’t crowd other birds.
2.  __Cohesion__: Move towards the center of nearby groups of birds.
3.  __Alignment__: Try to match the direction and speed of nearby birds.

The birds don’t communicate directly with each other, but they still form a cohesive and ever-evolving flock. Seen from afar, it’s almost as if they are a single organism.

If Hotelling is right, even if they try to differentiate themselves, all websites will eventually flock together.
