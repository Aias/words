Memory in online spaces works in an odd way. On a site like Facebook, everything is permanent. Once provided, data can never be truly deleted (unless you take the Draconian step of deleting your entire account). You can’t even remove your phone number from the site.

If you want an interesting surprise, go to your [Google Maps history][1]. Unless you’ve explicitly turned it off (or ‘paused’ it, in Google’s parlance), you’ll see your physical trail as reported by your mobile phone for the past several years (if you have an Android phone, or have Google maps installed with the necessary permissions). Not only does Google keep it indefinitely, but it’s available for the asking to anyone who gains access to your account.

This kind of eidetic memory is nothing like real life. Most of what we do and say is forgotten within a short time, and in the rare cases where we want a verbatim record, we have to make a special effort to create it. Things we do in one context are not likely to come back to haunt us years later in an unrelated setting. This forgetfulness gives us freedom, including the freedom to make mistakes, and lets us make decisions about what parts of our self we reveal where.

The online world forces individuals to make daily irrevocable decisions about their online footprint.

In the past, we assumed that when machines reached near-human performance in tasks like image recognition, it would be thanks to fundamental breakthroughs into the nature of cognition. We would be able to lift the lid on the human mind and see all the little gears turning.

What’s happened instead is odd. We found a way to get terrific results by combining fairly simple math with enormous data sets. But this discovery did not advance our understanding. The mathematical techniques used in machine learning don’t have a complex, intelligible internal structure we can reason about. Like our brains, they are a wild, interconnected tangle.
