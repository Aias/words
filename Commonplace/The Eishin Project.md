Our work on the Eishin Project began, as promised in the contract, with the construction of a pattern language. We spent four to five months engaging students, teachers, and administrators in creating this new pattern language, which would spring from their hopes and dreams as well as the land itself.

The very first thing we did was __spend two weeks just talking to different teachers and students, to get a feeling for their hopes and dreams__. These talks were one-on-one and often laster for an hour, for any one interview, during which we asked questions, talked, probed, explored dreams of an ideal campus, and tried to understand each person’s deepest visions as a teacher, or as a student.

This was not easy to do. It required much of both the interviewer and the person being interviewed. In the context of present-day Japan, where most schools are massive concrete boxes, with an asphalt playground on one side, it was hard to overcome this difficulty.  In any case, I always gently insisted. In answer to this kind of gentle invitation, most people would begin to say something. Relucantly, hesitatingly, often with some embarrassment, they would begin to describe their feelings about things — shyly, as if it was not allowed, or if it was crazy for them to attempt it. For example, one teacher said something like this to me: “I imagine walking by a stream, small streams and islands, perhaps bridges, and trees hanging in the water — a place where I can walk quietly and think about my class, or collect my thoughts as I prepare to teach.”

We shall see that many of these shyly presented, hesitating thoughts and feelings, were deeply true. They represented a real truth, which was demonstrated empirically once the school was built.

*Laying out the campus, with flags, so that we could all, together, feel the buildings and the spaces of the neighborhood, adjust them, again and again, until they felt just right.*

*This is the drawing made after placing of all the flags, as shown in the process at head of this page. These flags were carefully transcribed, by position, from the exact position in the field. These became the basis of the plan, and gave the life to the positions of the buildings as they may be seen in photographs: a rather simple naturalness, which arsies, actually, from careful, careful attention to the land, when placing the flags originally.*
