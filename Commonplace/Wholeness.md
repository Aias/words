In much the same way that making the complex clear is always objectively better than when things were unclear, I believe that working in terms of wholeness is always going to outperform working in terms of part-ness. Wholeness will also always be a slower process than part-ness, a near-guarantee that working in this way will require extraordinary clients who are “up for it.”
