Most people find that when it really gets down to pronouncing that one word just like we Americans do, it's not that they __can't__ pronounce it that way... it's that they don't want to. It's just too embarrassing to actually say that word just the way we really say it. I openly confess that it's pretty ridiculous that a whole nation in all seriousness actually talks like this, but that's the way it is. The point of this whole web site is that the sounds you pronounce in part define your personality. In order to talk like an American, you have to __be__ American. There's no way around this. So before you go on, ask yourself honestly whether you are truly willing to incorporate the American psyche into yourself on the cellular level.
