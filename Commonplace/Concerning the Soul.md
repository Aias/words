> "If I inspect a forest with the intention of buying it, renting it, cutting it down, going hunting in it, or mortgaging it, then I do not see the forest but only its relation to my desires, plans, and concerns. So it is with people, and with people's faces too. The man whom I look at with dread or hope, with greed, designs, or demands, is not a man but __a cloudy mirror of my own desire__."
