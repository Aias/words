The palette of emotional design for flatlanders is instead temporal. Temporal beauty lives in state-change animations, nuanced timing effects, strategically placed user feedback, and other “[interesting moments][1],” not drop shadows and Photoshop layer effects. Flatlanders build all kinds of emotion and depth combining these moments with delightful [microcopy][2], [personality][3], and [typography][4]. All honest—all web—all good.

In his 1953 essay, *The Language of an Organic Architecture*, master architect Frank Lloyd Wright called this kind of aesthetic “of the thing, not on it.”

Again and again, design history shows that when we try to trick a viewer into believing a material is something it’s not, the value and the timelessness of the design decrease. Industrial designer Norman Bel Geddes—and others—wrote volumes on this topic in the early twentieth century. Geddes coined his use of materials as “[a sincere style…of the materials involved][5].”

Rather than look for material honest processes in a long list of [new software design tools][6] (many of which will come and go quickly), we should invest in honest tools that will *forever* be part of the designer’s toolkit.

Enter the pen sketch.

Pen sketches are—and will forever be—the fastest, cheapest, and most universal way to create and share your ideas for any medium, particularly in early ideation phases. The pixel precision of wireframes can lead clients—and designers—into thinking there’s no design work left to explore once the first round of wireframes is complete. Or, precise wireframes can lead them to fuss with fonts, styling, and alignment of elements on a grid. These are the wrong things to focus upon in early design phases.

Because pen sketches are so far removed from web materials, they’re never confused for the final design. Even if you wanted to, it’s hard to fuss about fonts in a pen sketch. This keeps everyone focused on the right things at the right time. After the concepts are resolved through pen sketching, designers can [work honestly with clients][7] and [design in the browser][8] to bring the visual ideas and prototypes to life.
