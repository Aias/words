Cognitive dimensions or cognitive dimensions of notations are design principles for [notations][1], [user interfaces][2] and [programming languages][3], described by researchers [Thomas R.G. Green][4] and [Marian Petre][5]. The dimensions can be used to evaluate the [usability][6] of an existing *information artifact*, or as heuristics to guide the design of a new one.

__Abstraction gradient__
What are the minimum and maximum [levels of abstraction][8] exposed by the notation? Can details be [encapsulated][9]?

__Closeness of mapping__
How closely does the notation correspond to the [problem][10] world?

__Consistency__
After part of the notation has been [learned][11], how much of the rest can be successfully guessed?

__Diffuseness / terseness__
How many [symbols][12] or how much space does the notation require to produce a certain result or express a [meaning][13]?

__Error-proneness__
To what extent does the notation influence the likelihood of [the user making a mistake][14]?

__Hard mental operations__
How much [hard mental processing][15] lies at the notational level, rather than at the [semantic][16] level? Are there places where the user needs to resort to fingers or penciled annotation to keep track of what’s happening?

__Hidden dependencies__
Are [dependencies][17] between entities in the notation visible or hidden? Is every dependency indicated in both directions? Does a change in one area of the notation lead to unexpected consequences?

__Juxtaposability__
Can different parts of the notation be compared side-by-side at the same time?

__Premature commitment__
Are there strong constraints on the order in which the user must complete the tasks to use the system?

Are there decisions that must be made before all the necessary information is available? Can those decisions be reversed or corrected later?

__Progressive evaluation__
How easy is it to evaluate and obtain [feedback][18] on an incomplete solution?

__Role-expressiveness__
How obvious is the [role][19] of each component of the notation in the solution as a whole?

__Secondary notation and escape from formalism__
Can the notation carry extra information [by means not related to syntax][20], such as layout, color, or other cues?

__Viscosity__
Are there in the notation any inherent barriers to change? How much effort is required to make a change to a program expressed in the notation?

__Visibility__
How readily can required parts of the notation be identified, accessed and made visible?
