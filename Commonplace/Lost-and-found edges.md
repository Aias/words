> “Technically, everything we draw and paint should have lost-and-found edges. The idea is that you can stress or emphasize some boundaries with a found or hard boundary while minimizing other areas with a lost or soft boundary. Soft or lost edges help you to connect and mass together adjacent objects and shapes, avoiding the cut-out-and-pasted-down look of a painting done entirely with hard, found edges.”
