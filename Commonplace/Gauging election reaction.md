Unlike most applications of gauges, used to display a fixed single value, those used on election night were used to show live data. They were also used to convey the notion of swing (the very essence of the evening's proceedings), to show progressive movement along the scale and to also indicate levels of uncertainty. (You could argue that a linear gauge might have been more efficient in its use of space but I would guess that the mechanics of the radial gauge probably facilitate a smoother needle motion).
