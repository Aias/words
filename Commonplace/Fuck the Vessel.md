__Welcome to the depths of__ __architectural cynicism__

The Vessel is a structure that invites parody—it has already been likened to a giant shawarma, a beehive, a pine cone, a wastebasket. Apparently, there is to be a competition for a new name, as “The Vessel” was only supposed to be a temporary one. __It really is the perfect name, however, not least because it implies a certain emptiness. One asks, though, what it is a vessel for?__

It is a Vessel for the depths of architectural cynicism, of form without ideology and without substance: an architectural practice that puts the commodifiable image above all else, including the social good, aesthetic expression, and meaningful public space. It is a Vessel for the architecture of views, perhaps the hottest spatial commodity of all.

It is a Vessel for capital, for a real estate grift that can charge more for an already multi-million dollar apartment because it merely faces it. It is a Vessel for a so-called neighborhood that poorly masks its intention to build luxury assets for the criminally wealthy under the guise of investing in the city and “public space.” What is public space if not that land allocated (thanks to the generosity of our Real Estate overlords) to the city’s undeserving plebeians, who can interface with it in one of two ways: as consumers or interlopers, both allowed only to play from dawn ‘til dusk in the discarded shadows of the ultra-rich? Unlike a real neighborhood, which implies some kind of social collaboration or collective expression of belonging, Hudson Yards is a contrived place that was never meant for us. Because of this, the Vessel is also a Vessel for outrage like my own.

It is a Vessel for __labor without purpose__.

— *This is where I start to disagree with Wagner. She seems to believe that architecture without a useful or productive purpose is automatically pointless, which just isn’t true. Look at Foster’s reinterpretation of the Reichstag, a stairway ostensibly to nowhere, but which enables a meditative journey upwards, something contemplative, if a bit too popular with tourists. Why is it automatically a bad thing to build a sixteen story structure with no explicit purpose besides the climbing itself? Are mountains not worth climbing because there’s ’nothing at the top other than a view'? It sounds like Wagner isn’t so much against the Vessel as she is against climbing.*

The metaphor of the stairway to nowhere precludes a __tiring climb to the top__ where one is expected to spend a few moments with a cell-phone, because at least a valedictory selfie rewards us with the feeling that we __wasted time on a giant staircase__ for *something*—perhaps something contained in the Vessel. The Vessel __valorizes work, the physical work of climbing, all while cloaking it in the rhetoric of enjoyment,__ as if going up stairs were a particularly ludic activity. The inclusion of an elevator that only stops on certain platforms is ludicrously provocative. The presence of the elevator implies a pressure for the abled-bodied to not use it, since by doing so one bypasses “the experience” of the Vessel, __an experience of menial physical labor__ that aims to achieve the nebulous goal of attaining slightly different views of the city. Unlike the Eiffel Tower, to which the Vessel has been unfathomably compared, the Vessel is just tall enough to make you feel bad for not hiking up it. __To climb the Eiffel Tower is equally pointless__, but its sheer size makes taking the elevator the de facto, socially normalized experience. The elevators of the Vessel and their lackluster architectural integration belie the architectural profession’s view of accessibility as a code-enforced concession rather than an ethos, a moral right to architecture for all. By taking the elevator up the Vessel, you are both inviting the judgment of your peers who insist on __hauling ass up sixteen stories__ and confirming its __sheer pointlessness as a structure__; for, unlike the Eiffel Tower, which has a restaurant and shop, there is __nothing at the top other than a view__ of the Hudson and the sad promise of the repeat performance of laboring your way back down.
