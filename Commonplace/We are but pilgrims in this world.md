> “I really prefer the autumnal state of men and things, and of towns too. The transience of human life is paralleled in the visible signs of the transitoriness of inanimate objects. In the autumn, nature seems to be filled with a vegetal melody that also exudes from old walls and fills the heart with sadness, reminding us that we are but pilgrims in this world.”
